Recent developments in genetic and molecular biology have
excited world-wide interest in biotechnology. The ability to
manipulate DNA has already changed our perceptions of
medicine, agriculture and environmental management.
Scientific breakthroughs in gene expression, protein engineer-
ing and cell fusion are being translated by a strengthening
biotechnology industry into revolutionary new products and
services.
Many a student has been enticed by the promise ofbiotech-
nology and the excitement of being near the cutting edge of
scientific advancement. However, the value of biotechnology
is more likely to be assessed by business, government and con-
sumers alike in terms of commercial applications, impact on
the marketplace and financial success. Graduates trained in
molecular biology and cell manipulation soon realise that
these techniques are only part of the complete picture; bring-
ing about the full benefits of biotechnology requires
substantial manufacturing capability involving large-scale
processing of biological material. For the most part, chemical
engineers have assumed the responsibility for bioprocess
development. However, increasingly, biotechnologists are
being employed by companies to work in co-operation with
biochemical engineers to achieve pragmatic commercial goals.
Yet, while aspects of biochemistry, microbiology and molecu-
lar genetics have for many years been included in
chemical-engineering curricula, there has been relatively little
attempt to teach biotechnologists even those qualitative
aspects of engineering applicable to process design.
The primary aim of this book is to present the principles of
bioprocess engineering in a way that is accessible to biological
scientists. It does not seek to make biologists into bioprocess
engineers, but to expose them to engineering concepts and
ways of thinking. The material included in the book has been
used to teach graduate students with diverse backgrounds in
biology, chemistry and medical science. While several excel-
lent texts on bioprocess engineering are currently available,
these generally assume the reader already has engineering
training. On the other hand, standard chemical-engineering
texts do not often consider examples from bioprocessing and
are written almost exclusively with the petroleum and chemi-
cal industries in mind. There was a need for a textbook which
explains the engineering approach to process analysis while
providing worked examples and problems about biological
systems. In this book, more than 170 problems and calcula-
tions encompass a wide range of bioprocess applications
involving recombinant cells, plant- and animal-cell cultures
and immobilised biocatalysts as well as traditional fermenta-
tion systems. It is assumed that the reader has an adequate
background in biology.
One of the biggest challenges in preparing the text was
determining the appropriate level of mathematics. In general,
biologists do not often encounter detailed mathematical
analysis. However, as a great deal of engineering involves
formulation and solution of mathematical models, and many
important conclusions about process behaviour are best
explained using mathematical relationships, it is neither easy
nor desirable to eliminate all mathematics from a textbook
such as this. Mathematical treatment is necessary to show how
design equations depend on crucial assumptions; in other
cases the equations are so simple and their application so useful
that non-engineering scientists should be familiar with them.
Derivation of most mathematical models is fully explained in
an attempt to counter the tendency of many students to mem-
orise rather than understand the meaning of equations.
Nevertheless, in fitting with its principal aim, much more of
this book is descriptive compared with standard chemical-
engineering texts.
The chapters are organised around broad engineering sub-
disciplines such as mass and energy balances, fluid dynamics,
transport phenomena and reaction theory, rather than around
particular applications ofbioprocessing. That the same funda-
mental engineering principle can be readily applied to a variety
of bioprocess industries is illustrated in the worked examples
and problems. Although this textbook is written primarily for
senior students and graduates ofbiotechnology, it should also
be useful in food-, environmental- and civil-engineeringPreface

courses. Because the qualitative treatment of selected topics
is at a relatively advanced level, the book is appropriate for
chemical-engineering graduates, undergraduates and indus-
trial practitioners.
I would like to acknowledge several colleagues whose
advice I sought at various stages of manuscript preparation. Jay
Bailey, Russell Cail, David DiBiasio, Noel Dunn and Peter
Rogers each reviewed sections of the text. Sections 3.3 and
11.2 on analysis of experimental data owe much to Robert J.
Hall who provided lecture notes on this topic. Thanks are also
due to Jacqui Quennell whose computer drawing skills are
evident in most of the book's illustrations.

Bioprocess Development: An Interdisciplinary Challenge
Bioprocessing is an essentialpart of many food, chemical andpharmaceutical industries. Bioprocess operations make use of
microbial, animal andplant cells and components of cells such as enzymes to manufacture newproducts and destroy harmful
wastes.
Use of microorganisms to transform biological materials forproduction offermented foods has its origins in antiquity. Since
then, bioprocesseshave been developedfor an enormous range of commercialproducts, from relatively cheap materials such as
industrial alcohol and organic solvents, to expensive specialty chemicals such as antibiotics, therapeuticproteins and vaccines.
Industrially-useful enzymes and living cells such as bakers'and brewers'yeast are also commercialproducts of bioprocessing.
Table 1.1 gives examples of bioprocesses employing whole
cells. Typical organisms used and the approximate market size
for the products are also listed. The table is by no means
exhaustive; not included are processes for wastewater treat-
ment, bioremediation, microbial mineral recovery and
manufacture of traditional foods and beverages such as
yoghurt, bread, vinegar, soy sauce, beer and wine. Industrial
processes employing enzymes are also not listed in Table 1.1;
these include brewing, baking, confectionery manufacture,
fruit-juice clarification and antibiotic transformation. Large
quantities of enzymes are used commercially to convert starch
into fermentable sugars which serve as starting materials for
other bioprocesses.
Our ability to harness the capabilities of cells and enzymes
has been closely related to advancements in microbiology, bio-
chemistry and cell physiology. Knowledge in these areas is
expanding rapidly; tools of modern biotechnology such as
recombinant DNA, gene probes, cell fusion and tissue culture
offer new opportunities to develop novel products or improve
bioprocessing methods. Visions of sophisticated medicines,
cultured human tissues and organs, biochips for new-age com-
puters, environmentally-compatible pesticides and powerful
pollution-degrading microbes herald a revolution in the role
of biology in industry.
Although new products and processes can be conceived and
partially developed in the laboratory, bringing modern bio-
technology to industrial fruition requires engineering skills
and know-how. Biological systems can be complex and diffi-
cult to control; nevertheless, they obey the laws of chemistry
and physics and are therefore amenable to engineering analy-
sis. Substantial engineering input is essential in many aspects
of bioprocessing, including design and operation of bioreac-
tors, sterilisers and product-recovery equipment, development
of systems for process automation and control, and efficient
and safe layout of fermentation factories. The subject of this
book, bioprocessengineering, is the study of engineering prin-
ciples applied to processes involving cell or enzyme catalysts.
I.I Steps in Bioprocess Development:
A Typical New Product From Recombinant
DNA
The interdisciplinary nature of bioprocessing is evident if we
look at the stages of development required for a complete
industrial process. As an example, consider manufacture of a
new recombinant-DNA-derived product such as insulin,
growth hormone or interferon. As shown in Figure 1.1, several
steps are required to convert the idea of the product into com-
mercial reality; these stages involve different types of scientific
expertise.
The first stages ofbioprocess development (Steps 1-11) are
concerned with genetic manipulation of the host organism; in
this case, a gene from animal DNA is cloned into Escherichia
coil Genetic engineering is done in laboratories on a small
scale by scientists trained in molecular biology and biochemis-
try. Tools of the trade include Petri dishes, micropipettes,
microcentrifuges, nano-or microgram quantities of restriction
enzymes, and electrophoresis gels for DNA and protein frac-
tionation. In terms of bioprocess development, parameters of
major importance are stability of the constructed strains and
level of expression of the desired product.
After cloning, the growth and production characteristics ofI

the cells must be measured as a function of culture environ-
ment (Step 12). Practical skills in microbiology and kinetic
analysis are required; small-scale culture is mostly carried out
using shake flasks of 250-ml to 1-1itre capacity. Medium com-
position, pH, temperature and other environmental
conditions allowing optimal growth and productivity are
determined. Calculated parameters such as cell growth rate,
specific productivity and product yield are used to describe
performance of the organism.
Once the culture conditions for production are known,
scale-up of the process starts. The first stage may be a 1- or
2-1itre bench-top bioreactor equipped with instruments for
measuring and adjusting temperature, pH, dissolved-oxygen
concentration, stirrer speed and other process variables (Step
13). Cultures can be more closely monitored in bioreactors
than in shake flasks so better control over the process is poss-
ible. Information is collected about the oxygen requirements
of the cells, their shear sensitivity, foaming characteristics and
other parameters. Limitations imposed by the reactor on activ-
ity of the organism must be identified. For example, if the
bioreactor cannot provide dissolved oxygen to an aerobic cul-
ture at a sufficiently high rate, the culture will become
oxygen-starved. Similarly, in mixing the broth to expose the
cells to nutrients in the medium, the stirrer in the reactor may
cause cell damage. Whether or not the reactor can provide
conditions for optimal activity of the cells is of prime concern.
The situation is assessed using measured and calculated
parameters such as mass-transfer coefficients, mixing time, gas7
I Bioprocess Development: An Interdisciplinary Challenge
hold-up, rate of oxygen uptake, power number, impeller
shear-rate, and many others. It must also be decided whether
the culture is best operated as a batch, semi-batch or continu-
ous process; experimental results for culture performance
under various modes of reactor operation may be examined.
The viability of the process as a commercial venture is of great
interest; information about activity of the cells is used in
further calculations to determine economic feasibility.
Following this stage of process development, the system is
scaled up again to a pilot-scale bioreactor (Step 14). Engineers
trained in bioprocessing are normally involved in pilot-scale
operations. A vessel of capacity 100-1000 litres is built accord-
ing to specifications determined from the bench-scale
prototype. The design is usually similar to that which worked
best on the smaller scale. The aim of pilot-scale studies is to
examine the response of cells to scale-up. Changing the size of
the equipment seems relatively trivial; however, loss or varia-
tion of performance often occurs. Even though the geometry
of the reactor, method of aeration and mixing, impeller design
and other features may be similar in small and large ferment-
ers, the effect on activity of cells can be great. Loss of
productivity following scale-up may or may not be recovered;
economic projections often need to be re-assessed as a result of
pilot-scale findings.
If the scale-up step is completed successfully, design of the
industrial-scale operation commences (Step 15). This part of
process development is clearly in the territory of bioprocess
engineering. As well as the reactor itself, all of the auxiliary ser-
vice facilities must be designed and tested. These include air
supply and sterilisation equipment, steam generator and sup-
ply lines, medium preparation and sterilisation facilities,
cooling-water supply and process-control network. Particular
attention is required to ensure the fermentation can be carried
out aseptically. When recombinant cells or pathogenic organ-
isms are involved, design of the process must also reflect
containment and safety requirements.
An important part of the total process is product recovery
(Step 16), also known as downstream processing. After leaving
the fermenter, raw broth is treated in a series of steps to
produce the final product. Product recovery is often difficult
and expensive; for some recombinant-DNA-derived products,
purification accounts for 80-90% of the total processing cost.
Actual procedures used for downstream processing depend on
the nature of the product and the broth; physical, chemical or
biological methods may be employed. Many operations which
are standard in the laboratory become uneconomic or imprac-
tical on an industrial scale. Commercial procedures include
filtration, centrifugation and flotation for separation of cells
from the liquid, mechanical disruption of the cells if the
product is intracellular, solvent extraction, chromatography,
membrane filtration, adsorption, crystallisation and drying.
Disposal of effluent after removal of the desired product must
also be considered. Like bioreactor design, techniques applied
industrially for downstream processing are first developed and
tested using small-scale apparatus. Scientists trained in chem-
istry, biochemistry, chemical engineering and industrial
chemistry play important roles in designing product recovery
and purification "systems.
After the product has been isolated in sufficient purity it is
packaged and marketed (Step 17). For new pharmaceuticals
such as recombinant human growth hormone or insulin, medi-
cal and clinical trials are required to test the efficacy of the
product. Animals are used first, then humans. Only after these
trials are carried out and the safety of the product established
can it be released for general health-care application. Other
tests are required for food products. Bioprocess engineers with
a detailed knowledge of the production process are often
involved in documenting manufacturing procedures for sub-
mission to regulatory authorities. Manufacturing standards
must be met; this is particularly the case for recombinant prod-
ucts where a greater number of safety and precautionary
measures is required.
As shown in this example, a broad range of disciplines is
involved in bioprocessing. Scientists working in this area are
constantly confronted with biological, chemical, physical,
engineering and sometimes medical questions.
1.2 A Quantitative Approach
The biological characteristics of cells and enzymes often
impose constraints on bioprocessing; knowledge of them is
therefore an important prerequisite for rational engineering
design. For instance, thermostability properties must be taken
into account when choosing the operating temperature of an
enzyme reactor, while susceptibility of an organism to sub-
strate inhibition will determine whether substrate is fed to the
fermenter all at once or intermittently. It is equally true, how-
ever, that biologists working in biotechnology must consider
the engineering aspects ofbioprocessing; selection or manipu-
lation of organisms should be carried out to achieve the best
results in production-scale operations. It would be disappoint-
ing, for example, to spend a year or two manipulating an
organism to express a foreign gene if the cells in culture pro-
duce a highly viscous broth that cannot be adequately mixed
or supplied with oxygen in large-scale vessels. Similarly,
improving cell permeability to facilitate product excretion has
limited utility if the new organism is too fragile to withstand
the mechanical forces developed during fermenter operation.I Bioprocess Development: An Interdisciplinary Challenge
,
Another area requiring cooperation and understanding
between engineers and laboratory scientists is medium forma-
tion. For example, addition of serum may be beneficial to
growth of animal cells, but can significantly reduce product
yields during recovery operations and, in large-scale processes,
requires special sterilisation and handling procedures.
All areas of bioprocess development--the cell or enzyme
used, the culture conditions provided, the fermentation
equipment and product-recovery operations--are inter-
dependent. Because improvement in one area can be disad-
vantageous to another, ideally, bioprocess development
should proceed using an integrated approach. In practice,
combining the skills of engineers with those of biologists can
be difficult owing to the very different ways in which biologists
and engineers are trained. Biological scientists generally have
strong experimental technique and are good at testing qualita-
tive models; however, because calculations and equations are
not a prominent feature of the life sciences, biologists are usu-
ally less familiar with mathematics. On the other hand, as
calculations are important in all areas of equipment design and
process analysis, quantitative methods, physics and mathe-
matical theories play a central role in engineering. There is also
a difference in the way biologists and biochemical engineers
think about complex processes such as cell and enzyme func-
tion. Fascinating as the minutiae of these biological systems
may be, in order to build working reactors and other equip-
ment, engineers must take a simplified and pragmatic
approach. It is often disappointing for the biology-trained sci-
entist that engineers seem to ignore the wonder, intricacy and
complexity of life to focus only on those aspects which have
significant quantitative effect on the final outcome of the
process.
Given the importance of interaction between biology and
engineering in bioprocessing, these differences in outlook
between engineers and biologists must be overcome. Although
it is unrealistic to expect all biotechnologists to undertake full
engineering training, there are many advantages in under-
standing the practical principles of bioprocess engineering if
not the full theoretical detail. The principal objective of this
book is to teach scientists trained in biology those aspects of
engineering science which are relevant to bioprocessing. An
adequate background in biology is assumed. At the end of this
study, you will have gained a heightened appreciation for bio-
process engineering. You will be able to communicate on a
professional level with bioprocess engineers and know how to
analyse and critically evaluate new processing proposals. You
will be able to carry out routine calculations and checks on
processes; in many cases these calculations are not difficult and
can be of great value. You will also know what type of expertise
a bioprocess engineer can offer and when it is necessary to con-
sult an expert in the field. In the laboratory, your awareness of
engineering methods will help avoid common mistakes in data
analysis and design of experimental apparatus.
As our exploitation of biology continues, there is an
increasing demand for scientists trained in bioprocess technol-
ogy who can translate new discoveries into industrial-scale
production. As a biotechnologist, you could be expected to
work at the interface of biology and engineering science. This
textbook on bioprocess engineering is designed to prepare you
for this challenge.2
Introduction to Engineering Calculations
Calculations used in bioprocess engineering require a systematic approach with well-defined methods and rules. Conventions
and definitions which form the backbone of engineering analysis arepresented in this chapter. Many of these you will use over
and over again as you progress through this text. In laying the foundation for calculations andproblem-solving, this chapter
will be a useful reference which you may need to review fkom time to time.
The first step in quantitative analysis of systems is to express
the system properties using mathematical language. This
chapter begins by considering how physical and chemical pro-
cesses are translated into mathematics. The nature of physical
variables, dimensions and units are discussed, and formalised
procedures for unit conversions outlined. You will have
already encountered many of the concepts used in measure-
ment, such as concentration, density, pressure, temperature,
etc., rules for quantifying these variables are summarised here
in preparation for Chapters 4-6 where they are first applied to
solve processing problems. The occurrence of reactions in bio-
logical systems is of particular importance; terminology
involved in stoichiometric analysis is considered in this chapter.
Finally, since equations representing biological processes often
involve physical or chemical properties of materials, references
for handbooks containing this information are provided.
Worked examples and problems are used to illustrate and
reinforce the material described in the text. Although the ter-
minology and engineering concepts used in these examples
may be unfamiliar, solutions to each problem can be obtained
Table 2.1
using techniques fully explained within this chapter. Many of
the equations introduced as problems and examples are
explained in more detail in later sections of this book; the
emphasis in this chapter is on use of basic mathematical prin-
ciples irrespective of the particular application. At the end of
the chapter is a check-list so you can be sure you have assimi-
lated all the important points.
2.1 Physical Variables, Dimensions and
Units
Engineering calculations involve manipulation of numbers.
Most of these numbers represent the magnitude of measurable
physical variables, such as mass, length, time, velocity, area,
viscosity, temperature, density, and so on. Other observable
characteristics of nature, such as taste or aroma, cannot at
present be described completely using appropriate numbers;
we cannot, therefore, include these in calculations.
From all the physical variables in the world, the seven quan-
tities listed in Table 2.1 have been chosen by international

agreement as a basis for measurement [ 1]. Two further supple-
mentary units are used to express angular quantities. The base
quantities are called dimensions, and it is from these that the
dimensions of other physical variables are derived. For exam-
ple, the dimensions of velocity, defined as distance travelled
per unit time, are LT-1; the dimensions of force, being mass x
acceleration, are LMT-2. A list of useful derived dimensional
quantities is given in Table 2.2.
Physical variables can be classified into two groups: sub-
stantial variablesand natural variables.

Substantial Variables
Examples of substantial variables are mass, length, volume,
viscosity and temperature. Expression of the magnitude of
substantial variables requires a precise physical standard
against which measurement is made. These standards are
called units. You are already familiar with many units, e.g.
metre, foot and mile are units of length; hour and second are
units of time. Statements about the magnitude of substantial
variables must contain two parts: the number and the unit

ing car as 20 has no meaning unless information about the
units, say km h - 1, is also included.
As numbers representing substantial variables are multi-
plied, subtracted, divided or added, their units must also be
combined. The values of two or more substantial variables
may be added or subtracted only if their units are the same,
e.g.;
5.0 kg + 2.2 kg = 7.2 kg.
numerator exactly cancel those of the denominator. Other
dimensionless variables relevant to bioprocess engineering are
the Schmidt number, Prandtl number, Sherwood number,
Peclet number, Nusselt number, Grashof number, power
number and many others. Definitions and applications of
these natural variables are given in later chapters of this book.
In calculations involving rotational phenomena, rotation is
described using number of revolutions or radians:
number ofradians = length of arc
radius
On the other hand, the values and units ofanysubstantial vari-
ables can be combined by multiplication or division, e.g.:
1500 km
(2.2)
number of revolutions = length of arc _ length ofarc

The way in which units are carried along during calculations
has important consequences. Not only is proper treatment of
units essential if the final answer is to have the correct units,
units and dimensions can also be used as a guide when deduc-
ing how physical variables are related in scientific theories and
equations.
2.1.2 Natural Variables
The second group of physical variables are natural variables.
Specification of the magnitude of these variables does not
require units or any other standard of measurement. Natural
variables are also referred to as dimensionless variables, dimen-
sionless groups or dimensionless numbers. The simplest natural
variables are ratios of substantial variables. For example, the
aspect ratio of a cylinder is its length divided by its diameter;
the result is a dimensionless number.
Other natural variables are not as obvious as this, and
involve combinations of substantial variables that do not have
the same dimensions. Engineers make frequent use of dimen-
sionless numbers for succinct representation of physical
phenomena. For example, a common dimensionless group in
fluid mechanics is the Reynolds number, Re. For flow in a
pipe, the Reynolds number is given by the equation:
R e ---
2.1.3 Dimensional Homogeneity in Equations
Rules about dimensions determine how equations are formu-
lated. 'Properly constructed' equations representing general
relationships between physical variables must be dimension-
ally homogeneous. For dimensional homogeneity, the
dimensions of terms which are added or subtracted must be
the same, and the dimensions of the right-hand side of the
equation must be the same as the left-hand side. As a simple
example, consider the Margules equation for evaluating fluid
viscosity from experimental measurements:
M (11)

where r is radius. One revolution is equal to 2xr radians.
Radians and revolutions are non-dimensional because the
dimensions of length for arc, radius and circumference in Eqs
(2.2) and (2.3) cancel. Consequently, rotational speed (e.g.
number of revolutions per second) and angular velocity (e.g.
number ofradians per second), as well as frequency (e.g. num-
ber of vibrations per second), all have dimensions T -1.
Degrees, which are subdivisions of a revolution, are converted
into revolutions or radians before application in engineering
calculations.

where p is fluid density, u is fluid velocity, D is pipe diameter
and/~ is fluid viscosity. When the dimensions of these variables
are combined according to Eq. (2.1), the dimensions of the
The terms and dimensions in this equation are listed in Table
2.3. Numbers such as 4 have no dimensions; the symbol xr
represents the number 3.1415926536 which is also dimen-
sionless. A quick check shows that Eq. (2.4) is dimensionally
homogeneous since both sides of the equation have dimensionsI/,
2. Introduction to Engineering Calculations
L - 1 M T - 1 and all terms added or subtracted have the same
dimensions. Note that when a term such as Ro is raised to a
power such as 2, the units and dimensions of Ro must also be
raised to that power.
For dimensional homogeneity, the argument of any tran-
scendental function, such as a logarithmic, trigonometric or
exponential function, must be dimensionless. The following
examples illustrate this principle.

using an Arrhenius-type equation:

(2.7)
where % is the mutation reaction constant, E is specific
activation energy and R is the ideal gas constant (see
Section 2.5). The dimensions of RTare the same as those
of E, so the exponent is as it should be: dimensionless.
Dimensional homogeneity of equations can sometimes be
masked by mathematical manipulation. As an example, Eq.
(2.5) might be written:
lnx=
Table 2.3
In Xo +/at.
(2.8)
Inspection of this equation shows that rearrangement of the
terms to group In x and In x0 together recovers dimensional
homogeneity by providing a dimensionless argument for the
logarithm.
Integration and differentiation of terms affect dimension-
ality. Integration of a function with respect to x increases the
dimensions of that function by the dimensions of x.
Conversely, differentiation with respect to x results in the
dimensions being reduced by the dimensions ofx. For example,
if Cis the concentration of a particular compound expressed as
mass per unit volume and x is distance, dC/dx has dimensions
L-4M, while d2Qdx2 has dimensions L-5M. On the other
hand, if/a is the specific growth rate of an organism with
dimensions T - 1, then ~/a dt is dimensionless where t is time.
2.1.4 Equations Without Dimensional
Homogeneity
For repetitive calculations or when an equation is derived from
observation rather than from theoretical principles, it is
sometimes convenient to present the equation in a non-
homogeneous form. Such equations are called equations in
numerics or empirical equations. In empirical equations, the
units associated with each variable must be stated explicitly.
An example is Richards' correlation for the dimensionless gas
hold-up E in a stirred fermenter [2]:
(-~~)0"4 ul/2 = 30E +1.33
(2.9)
where P is power in units of horsepower, Vis ungassed liquid
volume in units of ft 3, u is linear gas velocity in units of ft s- 1
and E is fractional gas hold-up, a dimensionless variable. The
dimensions ofeach side of Eq. (2.9) are certainly not the same.
For direct application of Eq. (2.9), only those units stated
above can be used.z Introduction to Engineering Calculations

Units
Several systems of units for expressing the magnitude of physi-
cal variables have been devised through the ages. The metric
system of units originated from the National Assembly of
France in 1790. In 1960 this system was rationalised, and the
SI or Syst~me International d'Unitds was adopted as the inter-
national standard. Unit names and their abbreviations have
been standardised; according to SI convention, unit abbrevia-
tions are the same for both singular and plural and are not
followed by a period. SI prefixes used to indicate multiples and
sub-multiples of units are listed in Table 2.4. Despite wide-
spread use of SI units, no single system of units has universal
application. In particular, engineers in the USA continue to
apply British or imperial units. In addition, many physical
property data collected before 1960 are published in lists and
tables using non-standard units.
Familiarity with both metric and non-metric units is neces-
sary. Many units used in engineering such as the slug (1 slug -
14.5939 kilograms), dram (1 d r a m - 1.77185 grams), stoke (a
unit of kinematic viscosity), poundal (a unit of force) and erg
(a unit of energy), are probably not known to you. Although
no longer commonly applied, these are legitimate units which
may appear in engineering reports and tables of data.
In calculations it is often necessary to convert units. Units
are changed using conversionfactors. Some conversion factors,
such as 1 inch - 2.54 cm and 2.20 lb = 1 kg, you probably
already know. Tables of common conversion factors are given
in Appendix A at the back of this book. Unit conversions are
not only necessary to convert imperial units to metric; some
physical variables have several metric units in common use.
Table 2.4
For example, viscosity may be reported as centipoise or
kg h-1 m-1; pressure may be given in standard atmospheres,
pascals, or millimetres of mercury. Conversion of units seems
simple enough; however difficulties can arise when several vari-
ables are being converted in a single equation. Accordingly, an
organised mathematical approach is needed.
For each conversion factor, a unity bracket can be derived.
The value of the unity bracket, as the name suggests, is unity.
As an example,
1 lb - 453.6 g
(2.10)
can be converted by division of both sides of the equation by
1 lb to give a unity bracket denoted by I I:
1 = I 453.6 g
l i b ]"
(2.11)
Similarly, division of both sides of Eq. (2.10) by 453.6 g gives
another unity bracket:
1 lb ].
453.6 g
(2.12)
To calculate how many pounds are in 200 g, we can multiply
200 g bythe unity bracket inEq. (2.12) or divide 200 g bythe
unity bracket in Eq. (2.11). This is permissible since the value

2.3 Force and W e i g h t
1 lbf = 32.174 lbmftS -2
According to Newton's law, the force exerted on a body in
motion is proportional to its mass multiplied by the accelera-
tion. As listed in Table 2.2, the dimensions of force are
LMT-2; the natural units of force in the SI system are
kg m s-2. Analogously, g cm s-2 and lb ft s-2 are the natural
units of force in the metric and British systems, respectively.
Force occurs frequently in engineering calculations, and
derived units are used more commonly than natural units. In
SI, the derived unit is the newton, abbreviated as N:
1N=lkgms
-2.
(2.15)
In the British or imperial system, the derived unit for force is
defined as (1 lb mass) x (gravitational acceleration at sea level
and 45 ~ latitude). The derived force-unit in this case is called
the pound-force, and is denoted lbf:
(2.16)
as gravitational acceleration at sea level and 45 ~ latitude is
32.174 ft s -2. Note that pound-mass, represented usually as
lb, has been shown here using the abbreviation, Ibm, to distin-
guish it from lbf. Use of the pound in the imperial system for
reporting both Mass and force can be a source of confusion and
requires care.
In order to convert force from a defined unit to a natural
unit, a special dimensionless unity-bracket called gc is used.
The form of gc depends on the units being converted. From
Eqs (2.15) and (2.16):

(2.17)2 Introduction to Engineering Calculations
Weight is the force with which a body is attracted by gravity to
the centre of the earth. It changes according to the value of the
gravitational acceleration g, which varies by about 0.5% over
the earth's surface. In SI units gis approximately 9.8 m s-2; in
imperial units gis about 32.2 fi s -2. Using Newton's law and
depending on the exact value of g, the weight of a mass of 1 kg
is about 9.8 newtons; the weight of a mass of 1 lb is about
1 lbf. Note that although the value ofg changes with position
on the earth's surface (or in the universe), the value of gc
within a given system of units does not. gc is a factor for con-
verting units, not a physical variable.
2.4 Measurement Conventions
Familiarity with common physical variables and methods for
expressing their magnitude is necessary for engineering analysis
of bioprocesses. This section covers some useful definitions and
engineering conventions that will be applied throughout the text.
2.4.1
Density
Density is a substantial variable defined as mass per unit vol-
ume. Its dimensions are L-3M, and the usual symbol is 19.
Units for density are, for example, g cm -3, kg m -3 and
lb ft -3. If the density of acetone is 0.792 g cm -3, the mass of
150 cm 3 acetone can be calculated as follows:
16
density of water at 4~ is almost exactly 1.0000 g cm -3, we
can say immediately that the density of ethanol at 20~ is
0.789 g cm -3.
2.4.3
Specific V o l u m e
Specific volume is the inverse of density. The dimensions of
specific volume are L3M - 1.
2.4.4
Mole
In the SI system, a mole is 'the amount of substance of a system
which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms
in 0.012 kg ofcarbon- 12' [3]. This means that a mole in the SI
system is about 6.02 x 1023 molecules, and is denoted by the
term gram-mole or gmol. One thousand gmol is called a kilo-
gram-mole or kgrnol. In the American engineering system, the
basic mole unit is the pound-mole or lbmos which is 6.02 •
1023 • 453.6 molecules. The gmol, kgmol and lbmol therefore
represent three different quantities. When molar quantities
are specified simply as 'moles', gmol is usually meant.
The number of moles in a given mass of material is calculat-
ed as follows:
gram moles -
mass in grams
molar mass in grams
(2.18)
150 cm 3
0.792
g J = 119 g.
cm 3 /
Densities of solids and liquids vary slightly with temperature.
The density ofwater at 4~ is 1.0000 g cm -3, or 62.4 lb fi-3.
The density of solutions is a function of both concentration
and temperature. Gas densities are highly dependent on tem-
perature and pressure.
2.4.2
Specific Gravity
Specific gravity, also known as 'relative density', is a dimen-
sionless variable. It is the ratio of two densities, that of the
substance in question and that of a specified reference
material. For liquids and solids, the reference material is usual-
ly water. For gases, air is commonly used as reference, but
other reference gases may also be specified.
As mentioned above, liquid densities vary somewhat with
temperature. Accordingly, when reporting specific gravity the
temperatures of the substance and its reference material are
specified. If the specific gravity of ethanol is given as
20oc
0.7894o
C , this means that the specific gravity is 0.789 for
ethanol at 20~ referenced against water at 4~ Since the
lb moles =
mass in lb
molar mass in lb
(2.19)
Molar mass is the mass of one mole of substance, and has
dimensions MN - l . Molar mass is routinely referred to as
molecular weight, although the molecular weight of a com-
pound is a dimensionless quantity calculated as the sum of the
atomic weights of the elements constituting a molecule of that
compound. The atomic weightofan element is its mass relative
to carbon-12 having a mass of exactly 12; atomic weight is also
dimensionless. The terms 'molecular weight' and 'atomic
weight' are frequently used by engineers and chemists instead
of the more correct terms, 'relative molecular mass' and 'rela-
tive atomic mass'.
2.4.5
Chemical
Composition
Process streams usually consist of mixtures of components or
solutions of one or more solutes. The following terms are used
to define the composition of mixtures and solutions.
The molefraction of component A in a mixture is defined
as:2 Introduction to Engineering Calculations
mole fraction A =
I7
number of moles of A
total number of moles
(2.20)
Molepercentis mole fraction x 100. In the absence of chemical
reactions and loss of material from the system, the composition
of a mixture expressed in mole fraction or mole percent does
not vary with temperature.
The massfraction of component A in a mixture is defined as:
mass fraction A =
mass of A
total mass
(2.21)
Mass percent is mass fraction • 100; mass fraction and mass
percent are also called weight fraction and weight percent,
respectively. Another common expression for composition is
weight-for-weight percent (%w/w); although not so well
defined, this is usually considered to be the same as weight per-
cent. For example, a solution of sucrose in water with a
concentration of 40% w/w contains 40 g sucrose per 100 g
solution, 40 tonnes sucrose per 100 tonnes solution, 40 lb
sucrose per 1O0 lb solution, and so on. In the absence of chem-
ical reactions and loss of material from the system, mass and
weight percent do not change with temperature.
Because the composition of liquids and solids is usually
reported using mass percent, this can be assumed even if not
specified. For example, if an aqueous mixture is reported to
contain 5% N a O H and 3% MgSO 4, it is conventional to
assume that there are 5 g N a O H and 3 g MgSO 4 in every
100 g solution. Of course, mole or volume percent may be
used for liquid and solid mixtures; however this should be
stated explicitly, e.g. 10 vol% or 50 mole%.
The volumefraction of component A in a mixture is:
volume fraction A =
volume of A
total volume
(2.22)
Volume percent is volume fraction • 100. Although not as
clearly defined as volume percent, volume-for-volume percent
(%v/v) is usually interpreted in the same way as volume per-
cent; for example, an aqueous sulphuric acid mixture
containing 30 cm 3 acid in 1O0 cm 3 solution is referred to as a
30% (v/v) solution. Weight-for-volume percent (%w/v) is
also commonly used; a codeine concentration of 0.15% w/v
generally means O. 15 g codeine per 100 ml solution.
Compositions of gases are commonly given in volume per-
cent; if percentage figures are given without specification,
volume percent is assumed. According to the International
Critical Tables [4], the composition of air is 20.99% oxygen,
78.03% nitrogen, 0.94% argon and 0.03% carbon dioxide;
small amounts of hydrogen, helium, neon, krypton and xenon
make up the remaining 0.01%. For most purposes, all inerts
are lumped together with nitrogen; the composition of air is
taken as approximately 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen. This
means that any sample of air will contain about 21% oxygen
by volume. At low pressure, gas volume is directly proportional
to number of moles; therefore, the composition of air stated
above can be interpreted as 21 mole% oxygen. Since tempera-
ture changes at low pressure produce the same relative change
in partial volumes of constituent gases as in the total volume,
volumetric composition of gas mixtures is not altered by varia-
tion in temperature. Temperature changes affect the com-
ponent gases equally, so the overall composition is unchanged.
There are many other choices for expressing the concentra-
tion of a component in solutions and mixtures:
(i) Moles per unit volume, e.g. gmol l- 1, lbmol ft -3.
(ii) Mass per unit volume, e.g. kg m -3, g 1-1, lb ft -3.
(iii) Parts per million, ppm. This is used for very dilute solu-
tions. Usually, ppm is a mass fraction for solids and
liquids and a mole fraction for gases. For example, an
aqueous solution of 20 ppm manganese contains 20 g
manganese per 106 g solution. A sulphur dioxide con-
centration of 80 ppm in air means 80 gmol SO 2 per
106 gmol gas mixture. At low pressures this is equivalent
to 80 litres SO 2 per 106 litres gas mixture.
(iv) Molarity, gmol 1-1.
(v) Molality, gmol per 1000 g solvent.
(vi) Normality, mole equivalents 1-1. A normal solution con-
tains one equivalent gram-weight of solute per litre of
solution. For an acid or base, an equivalent gram-weight
is the weight of solute in grams that will produce or react
with one gmol hydrogen ions. Accordingly, a 1 N solu-
tion of HCI is the same as a 1 M solution; on the other
hand, a 1 N H2SO 4 or 1 N Ca(OH) 2 solution is 0.5 M.
(vii) Formality, formula gram-weight 1-1 . If the molecular
weight of a solute is not clearly defined, formality may be
used to express concentration. A formal solution contains
one formula gram-weight of solute per litre of solution. If
the formula gram-weight and molecular gram-weight are
the same, molarity and formality are the same.
In several industries, concentration is expressed in an indirect
way using specific gravity. For a given solute and solvent, the
density and specific gravity of solutions are directly dependent
on concentration of solute. Specific gravity is conveniently
measured using a hydrometer which may be calibrated using
special scales. The Baumd scale, originally developed in France
to measure levels of salt in brine, is in common use. One2. Introduction to Engineering Calculations
18
Baumd scale is used for liquids lighter than water; another is
used for liquids heavier than water. For liquids heavier than
water such as sugar solutions:
degrees Baumd (~
= 145 -
145
G
(2.23)
where G is specific gravity. Unfortunately, the reference tem-
perature for the Baumd and other gravity scales is not
standardised world-wide. If the Baumd hydrometer is calibrat-
ed at 60~ (15.6~
G in Eq (2.23) would be the specific
gravity at 60~ relative to water at 60~ however another
common reference temperature is 20~ (68~
The Baumd
scale is used widely in the wine and food industries as a meas-
ure of sugar concentration. For example, readings of~ from
grape juice help determine when grapes should be harvested
for wine making. The Baum~ scale gives only an approximate
indication of sugar levels; there is always some contribution to
specific gravity from soluble compounds other than sugar.
Degrees Brix (~
or degreesBalling, is another hydrometer
scale used extensively in the sugar industry. Brix scales calibrated
at 15.6~ and 20~ are in common use. With the 20~ scale,
each degree Brix indicates 1 gram of sucrose per 1O0 g liquid.
2.4.6
Temperature
Temperature is a measure of the thermal energy of a body at
thermal equilibrium. It is commonly measured in degrees
Celsius (centigrade) or Fahrenheit. In science, the Celsius scale
is most common; O~ is taken as the ice point of water and
100~ the normal boiling point of water. The Fahrenheit scale
has everyday use in the USA; 32~ represents the ice point and
212~ the normal boiling point of water. Both Fahrenheit and
Celsius scales are relative temperature scales, i.e. their zero
points have been arbitrarily assigned.
Sometimes it is necessary to use absolute temperatures.
Absolute-temperature scales have as their zero point the lowest
temperature believed possible. Absolute temperature is used in
application of the ideal gas law and many other laws of ther-
modynamics. A scale for absolute temperature with degree
units the same as on the Celsius scale is known as the Kelvin
scale; the absolute-temperature scale using Fahrenheit degree-
units is the Rankine scale. Units on the Kelvin scale used to be
termed 'degrees Kelvin' and abbreviated ~ It is modern prac-
tice, however, to name the unit simply 'kelvin'; the SI symbol
for kelvin is K. Units on the Rankine scale are denoted ~ O~
= 0 K - - 4 5 9 . 6 7 ~ - -273.15~
Comparison of the four
temperature scales is shown in Figure 2.1. One unit on the
Kelvin-Celsius scale corresponds to a temperature difference
of 1.8 times a single unit on the Rankine-Fahrenheit scale; the
range of 180 Rankine-Fahrenheit degrees between the freez-
ing and boiling points of water corresponds to 100 degrees on
the Kelvin-Celsius scale.
Equations for converting temperature units are as follows;

2.4.7
Pressure
Pressure is defined as force per unit area, and has dimensions
L - I M T -2. Units of pressure are numerous, including pounds
per square inch (psi), millimetres of mercury (mmHg), stan-
dard atmospheres (atm), bar, newtons per square metre
(N m-2), and many others. The SI pressure unit, N m -2, is
called a pascal (Pa). Like temperature, pressure may be
expressed using absolute or relative scales.
Absolute pressure is pressure relative to a complete vacuum.
Because this reference pressure is independent of location,
temperature and weather, absolute pressure is a precise and
invariant quantity. However, absolute pressure is not com-
monly measured. Most pressure-measuring devices sense the
difference in pressure between the sample and the surrounding
atmosphere at the time of measurement. Measurements using
these instruments give relative pressure, also known as gauge
pressure. Absolute pressure can be calculated from gauge
pressure as follows:
absolute pressure = gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure.
(2.28)
As you know from listening to weather reports, atmospheric
pressure varies with time and place and is measured using a
barometer. Atmospheric pressure or barometricpressure should
not be confused with the standard unit of pressure called the
standard atmosphere (atm), defined as 1.013 • 105 N m -2,
14.70 psi, or 760 m m H g at 0~ Sometimes the units for
pressure include information about whether the pressure is
absolute or relative. Pounds per square inch is abbreviated psia
for absolute pressure or psig for gauge pressure. Atma denotes
standard atmospheres of absolute pressure.2 Introduction to Engineering Calculations

Vacuum pressure is another pressure term, used to indicate
pressure below barometric pressure. A gauge pressure of
- 5 psig, or 5 psi below atmospheric, is the same as a vacuum
of 5 psi. A perfect vacuum corresponds to an absolute pressure
of zero.

Standard
Conditions
and
Ideal
Gases
A standard state of temperature and pressure has been defined
and is used when specifying properties of gases, particularly
molar volumes. Standard conditions are needed because the
volume of a gas depends not only on the quantity present but
also on the temperature and pressure. The most widely-
adopted standard state is 0~ and 1 atm.
Relationships between gas volume, pressure and tempera-
ture were formulated in the 18th and 19th centuries. These
correlations were developed under conditions of temperature
and pressure so that the average distance between gas molecules
was great enough to counteract the effect of intramolecular
forces, and the volume of the molecules themselves could be
neglected. Under these conditions, a gas became known as an
idealgas. This term now in c o m m o n use refers to a gas which
obeys certain simple physical laws, such as those of Boyle,
Charles and Dalton. Molar volumes for an ideal gas at stand-
ard conditions are:
1 gmol = 22.4 litres
(2.29)
1 kgmol = 22.4 m 3
(2.30)
1 lbmol = 3 5 9 ft 3.
(2.31)
No real gas is an ideal gas at all temperatures and pressures.
However, light gases such as hydrogen, oxygen and air deviate20
z Introduction to Engineering Calculations
negligibly from ideal behaviour over a wide range of condi-
tions. On the other hand, heavier gases such as sulphur dioxide
and hydrocarbons can deviate considerably from ideal, parti-
cularly at high pressures. Vapours near the boiling point also
deviate markedly from ideal. Nevertheless, for many applica-
tions in bioprocess engineering, gases can be considered ideal
without much loss of accuracy.
Eqs (2.29)-(2.31 ) can be verified using the idealgas law:
Table 2.5
p V - nRT
(2.32)
where p is absolute pressure, V is volume, n is moles, T is abso-
lute temperature and R is the idealgas constant. Eq. (2.32) can
be applied using various combinations of units for the physical
variables, as long as the correct value and units of R are
employed. Table 2.5 gives a list of Rvalues in different systems
of units.

Therefore, the total mass is (2189.6 + 614.4 + 114.4) g = 2918.4 g. The mass composition can be calculated as follows:
Mass percent N 2 = 2189.6g x 100 = 75.0%

Mass percent 0 2 = 614.4 g x 100 = 21.1%

Therefore, the composition of the gas is 75.0 mass% N 2, 21.1 mass% 0 2 and 3.9 mass% C O 2.
(b) As the gas composition is given in volume percent, in each cubic metre of gas there must be 0.026 m 3 C O 2. The relationship
between moles of gas and volume at 1 atm and 25~ is determined using Eq. (2.32) and Table 2.5"

Physical and Chemical Property Data
Information about the properties of materials is often required
in engineering calculations. Because measurement of physical
and chemical properties is time-consuming and expensive,
handbooks containing this information are a tremendous
resource. You may already be familiar with some handbooks of
physical and chemical data, including:
(i) InternationalCritical Tables[4]
(ii) Handbookof Chemistry andPhysics [5]; and
(iii) Handbookof Chemistry [6].
To these can be added:
(iv)
ChemicalEngineers"Handbook [7];
and, for information about biological materials,2 Introduction to Engineering Calculations
(v)
2,2,
BiochemicalEngineering and Biotechnology Handbook [8].
A selection of physical and chemical property data is included
in Appendix B.
2.7 Stoichiometry
In chemical or biochemical reactions, atoms and molecules
rearrange to form new groups. Mass and molar relationships
between the reactants consumed and products formed can be
determined using stoichiometric calculations. This informa-
tion is deduced from correctly-written reaction equations and
relevant atomic weights.
As an example, consider the principal reaction in alcohol fer-
mentation: conversion of glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide:
C6H1206 --+ 2 C2H60 .+ 2 CO 2.
(2.33)
This reaction equation states that one molecule of glucose
breaks down to give two molecules of ethanol and two mole-
cules of carbon dioxide. Applying molecular weights, the
equation shows that reaction.of 180 g glucose produces 92 g
ethanol and 88 g carbon dioxide. During chemical or bio-
chemical reactions, the following two quantities are
conserved:
total mass, i.e. total mass of reactants = total mass of
products; and
(ii) number ofatoms of each element, e.g. the number of C, H
and O atoms in the reactants = the number of C, H and
O atoms, respectively, in the products.
(i)
Note that there is no corresponding law for conservation of
moles; moles of reactants, moles of products.
Example 2.4 Stoichiometry of amino acid synthesis
The overall reaction for microbial conversion of glucose to L-glutamic acid is:
C6H120 6 + NH 3 + 3/20 2 --+ CsH9NO 4 + CO 2 + 3 H20.
(glucose)
(glutamic acid)
What mass of oxygen is required to produce 15 g glutamic acid?
Solution:
Molecular weights:
oxygen
=
glutamicacid =
32
147
In the following equation, g glutamic acid is converted to gmol using a unity bracket for molecular weight, the stoichiometric equa-
tion is applied to convert gmol glutamic acid to gmol oxygen, and finally gmol oxygen are converted to g for the final answer:
15 g glumatic acid.
1 gmol glutamic acid3/2 gmo10232g0 2
147 g glutamic acid1 gmol glutamic acid1 gmol 0 2
= 4.9 g 0 2.
Therefore, 4.9 g oxygen is required. More oxygen will be needed if microbial growth also occurs.
By themselves, equations such as (2.33) suggest that all the
reactants are converted into the products specified in the equa-
tion, and that the reaction proceeds to completion. This is
often not the case for industrial reactions. Because the stoichi-
ometry may not be known precisely, or in order to manipulate
the reaction beneficially, reactants are not usually supplied in
the exact proportions indicated by the reaction equation.
Excess quantities of some reactants may be provided; this
excess material is found in the product mixture once the reac-
tion is stopped. In addition, reactants are often consumed in
side reactions to make products not described by the principal
reaction equation; these side-products also form part of the
final reaction mixture. In these circumstances, additional
information is needed before the amounts of product formed
or reactants consumed can be calculated. Terms used to
describe partial and branched reactions are outlined below.2. Introduction to Engineering Calculations
~3
The limiting reactant is the reactant present in the small-
est stoichiometric amount. While other reactants may be
present in smaller absolute quantities, at the time when
the last molecule of the limiting reactant is consumed,
residual amounts of all reactants except the limiting reac-
tant will be present in the reaction mixture. As an
illustration, for the glutamic acid reaction of Example
2.4, if 100 g glucose, 17 g N H 3 and 48 g 0 2 are provided
for conversion, glucose will be the limiting reactant even
though a greater mass of it is available compared with the
other substrates.
(ii) An excess reactant is a reactant present in an amount in
excess of that required to combine with all of the limiting
reactant. It follows that an excess reactant is one remain-
ing in the reaction mixture once all the limiting reactant
is consumed. The percentage excess is calculated using the
amount of excess material relative to the quantity required
for complete consumption of the limiting reactant:
(i)
moles present - moles required to react)
completely with the limiting reactant
% excess =
moles required to react

(2.34)
or
% excess =
mass present - mass required to react
completely with the limiting reactant
(
mass required to react
)
completely with the limiting reactant
x 100.
(2.35)
The required amount of a reactant is the stoichiometric
quantity needed for complete conversion of the limiting
reactant. In the above glutamic acid example, the
required amount of N H 3 for complete conversion of
100 g glucose is 9.4 g; therefore if 17 g N H 3 are pro-
vided the percent excess N H 3 is 80%. Even if only part
of the reaction actually occurs, required and excess quan-
tities are based on the entire amount of the limiting
reactant.
Other reaction terms are not as well defined with multiple def-
initions in common use:
(iii) Conversion is the fraction or percentage of a reactant con-
verted into products.
(iv) Degree of completion is usually the fraction or percentage
of the limiting reactant converted into products.
(v) Selectivity is the amount of a particular product formed
as a fraction of the amount that would have been formed
if all the feed material had been converted to that
product.
(vi) Yield is the ratio of mass or moles of product formed to
the mass or moles of reactant consumed. If more than one
product or reactant is involved in the reaction, the parti-
cular compounds referred to must be stated, e.g. the yield
of glutamic acid from glucose was 0.6 g g-1. Because of
the complexity of metabolism and the frequent occur-
rence of side reactions, yield is an important term in
bioprocess analysis. Application of the yield concept for
cell and enzyme reactions is described in more detail in
Chapter 11.
Example 2.5 Incomplete reaction and yield
Depending on culture conditions, glucose can be catabolised by yeast to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide, or can be diverted
into other biosynthetic reactions. An inoculum of yeast is added to a solution containing 10 g 1-1 glucose. After some time only
1 g 1-1 glucose remains while the concentration of ethanol is 3.2 g 1- I. Determine:
(a) the fractional conversion of glucose to ethanol; and
(b) the yield of ethanol from glucose.
Solution:
(a) To find the fractional conversion of glucose to ethanol, we must first determine exactly how much glucose was directed into
ethanol biosynthesis. Using a basis of 1 litre and Eq. (2.33) for ethanol fermentation, we can calculate the mass of glucose
required for synthesis of 3.2 g ethanol:
3.2 g ethanol .
1 gmol ethanol1 gmol glucose180 g glucose
46 g ethanol2 gmol ethanol1 gmol glucose
- 6.3 g glucose.2 Introduction to Engineering Calculations
2,4
Therefore, based on the total amount of glucose provided per litre (10 g), the fractional conversion of glucose to ethanol was
0.63. Based on the amount of glucose actually consumed per litre (9 g), the fractional conversion to ethanol was 0.70.
(b) Yield of ethanol from glucose is based on the total mass of glucose consumed. Since 9 g glucose was consumed per litre to
provide 3.2 g 1-1 ethanol, the yield of ethanol from glucose was 0.36 g g-1. We can also conclude that, per litre, 2.7 g
glucose was consumed but not used for ethanol synthesis.

Stoichiometric equations are used to represent growth of

Presentation and Analysis of Data
Quantitative information isfundamental to scientific and engineering analysis. Information about bioprocesses, such as the
amount of substrate fed into the system, the operating conditions, and properties of the product stream, is obtained by
measuringpertinentphysical and chemical variables. In industry, data are collectedfor equipment design, process control,
trouble-shooting and economic evaluations. In research, experimental data are used to develop new theories and test
theoreticalpredictions. In either case, quantitative interpretation of data is absolutely essentialfor making rational decisions
about the system under investigation. The ability to extract useful and accurate information from data is an important skill
for any scientist. Professionalpresentation and communication of results is also required.
Techniques for data analysis must take into account the exis-
tence of error in measurements. Because there is always an
element of uncertainty associated with measured data,
interpretation calls for a great deal of judgement. This is espe-
cially the case when critical decisions in design or operation of
processes depend on data evaluation. Although computers and
calculators make data processing less tedious, the data analyst
must possess enough perception to use these tools effectively.
This chapter discusses sources of error in data and methods
of handling errors in calculations. Presentation and analysis of
data using graphs and equations and presentation of process
information using flow sheets are described.
3.1 Errors in Data and Calculations
Measurements are never perfect. Experimentally-determined
quantities are always somewhat inaccurate due to measure-
ment error; absolutely 'correct' values of physical quantities
(time, length, concentration, temperature, etc.) cannot be
found. The significance or reliability of conclusions drawn
from data must take measurement error into consideration.
Estimation of error and principles of error propagation in cal-
culations are important elements of engineering analysis and
help prevent misleading representation of data. General prin-
ciples for estimation and expression of errors are discussed in
the following sections.
3.1.1 Significant Figures
Data used in engineering calculations vary considerably in
accuracy. Economic projections may estimate market demand
for a new biotechnology product to within • 100%; on the
other hand, some properties of materials are known to within
•
or less. The uncertainty associated with quantities
should be reflected in the way they are written. The number of
figures used to report a measured or calculated variable is an
indirect indication of the precision to which that variable is
known. It would be absurd, for example, to quote the estim-
ated income from sales of a new product using ten decimal
places. Nevertheless, the mistake of quoting too many figures
is not uncommon; display of superfluous figures on calculators
is very easy but should not be transferred to scientific reports.
A significantfigure is any digit, 1-9, used to specify a num-
ber. Zero may also be a significant figure when it is not used
merely to locate the position of the decimal point. For exam-
ple, the numbers 6304, 0.004321, 43.55 and 8.063 • 10 l~
each contain four significant figures. For the number 1200,
however, there is no way of knowing whether or not the two
zeros are significant figures; a direct statement or an alternative
way of expressing the number is needed. For example,
1.2 • 103 has two significant figures, while 1.200 • 103 has
four.
A number is rounded to n significant figures using the fol-
lowing rules:
(i) If the number in the (n + 1)th position is less than 5, dis-
card all figures to the right of the nth place.
(ii) If the number in the (n + 1)th position is greater than 5,
discard all figures to the right of the nth place, and
increase the nth digit by 1.
(iii) If the number in the (n + 1)th position is exactly 5, discard
all figures to the right of the nth place, and increase the
nth digit by 1.3 Presentation and Analysis of Data
For example, when rounding off to four significant figures:
1.426348 becomes 1.426;
1.426748 becomes 1.427; and
1.4265 becomes 1.427.
The last rule is not universal but is engineering convention;
most electronic calculators and computers round up halves.
Generally, rounding off means that the value may be wrong by
up to 5 units in the next number-column not reported. Thus,
10.77 kg means that the mass lies somewhere between
10.765 kg and 10.775 kg, whereas 10.7754 kg represents a
mass between 10.77535 kg and 10.77545 kg. These rules
apply only to quantities based on measured values; some num-
bers used in calculations refer to precisely known or counted
quantities. For example, there is no error associated with the
number 1/:2in the equation for kinetic energy:
kinetic energy = k k = 1/2 M V 2
where M is mass and v is velocity.
It is good practice during calculations to carry along one or
two extra significant figures for combination during arith-
metic operations; final rounding-off should be done only at
the end. How many figures should we quote in the final
answer? There are several rules-of-thumb for rounding off
after calculations, so rigid adherence to all rules is not always
possible. However as a guide, after multiplication or division,
the number of significant figures in the result should equal the
smallest number of significant figures of any of the quantities
involved in the calculation. For example:
(6.681 x 10 -2) (5.4 x 109) = 3.608 x 108 --+ 3.6 x 108
and
6.16
0.054677
= 112.6616310 -+ 113.
For addition and subtraction, look at the position of the last
significant figure in each number relative to the decimal point.
The position of the last significant figure in the result should
be the same as that most to the left, as illustrated below:
24.335 + 3.90 + 0.00987 = 28.24487 ---> 28.24
and
121.808- 112.87634=8.93166 -+ 8.932.

3.1.2
Absolute and Relative Uncertainty
Uncertainty associated with measurements can be stated more
explicitly than is possible using the rules of significant figures.
For a particular measurement, we should be able to give our
best estimate of the parameter value, and the interval repre-
senting its range of uncertainty. For example, we might be able
to say with confidence that the prevailing temperature lies
between 23.7~ and 24.3~ Another way of expressing this
result is 24 • 0.3~ The value • 0.3~ is known as the uncer-
tainty or error of the measurement, and allows us to judge the
quality of the measuring process. Since + 0.3~ represents the
actual temperature range by which the reading is uncertain, it
is known as the absolute error. An alternative expression for
24 + 0.3~ is 24~ • 1.25%; in this case the relative error is
• 1.25%.
Because most values of uncertainty must be estimated
rather than measured, there is a rule-of-thumb that magni-
tudes of errors should be given with only one or two significant
figures. A flow rate may be expressed as 146 • 13 gmol h-l,
even though this means that two figures, i.e. the '4' and the '6'
in the result, are uncertain. The number of digits used to
express the result should be compatible with the magnitude of
its estimated error. For example, in the statement: 2.1437 •
0.12 grams, the estimated uncertainty of 0.12 grams shows
that the last two digits in the result are superfluous. Use of
more than three significant figures in this case gives a false
impression of accuracy.
There are rules for combining errors during mathematical
operations. The uncertainty associated with calculated results
is found from the errors associated with the raw data. For addi-
tion and subtraction the rule is: a d d absolute errors. The total of
the absolute errors becomes the absolute error associated with
the final answer. For example, the sum of 1.25 • 0.13 and
0.973 • 0.051 is:
(1.25 + 0.973) + (0.13 + 0.051) = 2.22 • O. 18 = 2.22 • 8.1%.
Considerable loss of accuracy can occur after subtraction,
especially when two large numbers are subtracted to give an
answer of small numerical value. Because the absolute error
after subtraction of two numbers always increases, the relative
error associated with a small-number answer can be very great.
For example, consider the difference between two numbers,
each with small relative error: 12 736 + 0.5% and 12 681 +
0.5%. For subtraction, the absolute errors are added:
(12 7 3 6 + 6 4 ) - ( 1 2 681 + 6 3 ) = 5 5 + 127=55 +230%.3 Presentation and Analysis of Data
Even though it could be argued that the two errors might
almost cancel each other (if one were +64 and the other were
- 6 3 , for example), we can never be certain that this would
occur. 230% represents the worst case or maximum possible
error. For measured values, any small number obtained by sub-
traction of two large numbers must be examined carefully and
with justifiable suspicion. Unless explicit errors are reported,
the large uncertainty associated with results can go unnoticed.
For multiplication and division: add relative errors. The
total of the relative errors becomes the relative error associated
with the answer. For example, 164 • 1 divided by 790 • 20 is
the same as 164 • 0.61% divided by 790 • 2.5%:
(790/164) • (2.5 + 0.61)% = 4.82 _ 3.1% = 4.82 • 0.15.
Propagation of errors in more complex expressions will not be
discussed here; more information and rules for combining
errors can be found in other references [ 1-3].
So far we have considered the error occurring in a single
observation. However, as discussed below, better estimates of
errors are obtained by taking repeated measurements. Because
this approach is useful only for certain types of measurement
error, let us consider the various sources of error in experi-
mental data.
3.1.3
Types of Error
There are two broad classes of measurement error: systematic
and random. A systematic error is one which affects all meas-
urements of the same variable in the same way. If the cause of
systematic error is identified, it can be accounted for using a
correction factor. For example, errors caused by an imperfectly
calibrated analytical balance may be identified using standard
weights; measurements with the balance can then be corrected
to compensate for the error. Systematic errors easily go un-
detected; performing the same measurement using different
instruments, methods and observers is required to detect
systematic error [4].
Random or accidental errors are due to unknown causes.
Random errors are present in almost all data; they are revealed
when repeated measurements of an unchanging quantity give
a 'scatter' of different results. As outlined in the next section,
scatter from repeated measurements is used in statistical analy-
sis to quantify random error. The term precision refers to the
reliability or reproducibility of data, and indicates the extent to
which a measurement is free from random error. Accuracy, on
the other hand, requires both random and systematic errors to
be small. Repeated weighings using a poorly-calibrated
z9
balance can give results that are very precise (because each
reading is similar); however the result would be inaccurate
because of the incorrect calibration and systematic error.
During experiments, large, isolated, one-of-a-kind errors
can also occur. This type of error is different from the system-
atic and random errors mentioned above and can be described
as a 'blunder'. Accounting for blunders in experimental data
requires knowledge of the experimental process and judge-
ment about the likely accuracy of the measurement.
3.1.4
Statistical Analysis
Measurements containing random errors but free of system-
atic errors and blunders can be analysed using statistical
procedures. Details are available in standard texts, e.g. [5];
only the most basic techniques for statistical treatment will be
described here. From readings containing random error, we
aim to find the best estimate of the variable measured, and to
quantify the extent to which random error affects the data.
In the following analysis, errors are assumed to follow a
normal or Gaussian distribution. Normally-distributed ran-
dom errors in a single measurement are just as likely to be
positive as negative; thus, if an infinite number of repeated
measurements were made of the same variable, random error
would completely cancel out from the arithmetic mean of
these values. For less than an infinite number of observations,
the arithmetic mean of repeated measurements is still regarded
as the best estimate of the variable, provided each measure-
ment is made with equal care and under identical conditions.
Taking replicate measurements is therefore standard practice
in science; whenever possible, several readings of each datum
point should be obtained. For variable x measured n times, the
arithmetic mean is calculated as follows:
~c = mean value o f x - ~ x
n
_
x 1 + x 2 + x 3 +...
Xn .
n
(3.1)
As indicated, the symbol E represents the sum of n values;
ft, x means the sum of n values of parameter x.
In addition to the mean, we need some measure of the pre-
cision of the measurements; this is obtained by considering the
scatter of individual values about the mean. The deviation of
an individual value from the mean is known as the residual; an
example of a residual is (x 1 - ~ ) where x 1 is a measurement in
a set of replicates. The most useful indicator of the magnitude
of the residuals is the standard deviation. For a set of experi-
mental data, standard deviation o" is calculated as follows:3 Presentation and Analysis of Data

n .~)2
n-1

n-1
(3.2)
Eq. (3.2) is the definition used by most modern statisticians
and manufacturers of electronic calculators; or as defined in
Eq. (3.2) is sometimes called the sample standard deviation.
Therefore, to report the results of repeated measurements,
we quote the mean as the best estimate of the variable, and the
standard deviation as a measure of the confidence we place in
the result. The units and dimensions of the mean and standard
deviation are the same as those of x. For less than an infinite
number of repeated measurements, the mean and standard
deviation calculated using one set of observations will produce
a different result from that determined using another set. It
can be shown mathematically that values of the mean and
standard deviation become more reliable as n increases; taking
replicate measurements is therefore standard practice in
science. A compromise is usually struck between the conflict-
ing demands of precision and the time and expense of
experimentation; sometimes it is impossible to make a large
number of replicate measurements. Sample size should always
be quoted when reporting the outcome of statistical analysis.
When substantial improvement in the accuracy of the mean
and standard deviation is required, this is generally more effec-
tively achieved by improving the intrinsic accuracy of the
measurement rather than by just taking a multitude of
repeated readings.
Example 3.1 Mean and standard deviation
The final concentration of l.-lysine produced by a regulatory mutant of Brevibacterium lactofermentum is measured 10 times.
The results in g l - l are: 47.3, 51.9, 52.2, 51.8, 49.2, 51.1, 52.4, 47.1,49.1 and 46.3. How should the lysine concentration be
reported?
Solution:
For this sample, n= 10. From Eq. (3.1):
47.3+51.9+52.2+51.8+49.2+51.1
10
= 49.84 g 1-1.
~=
+ 5 2 . 4 + 4 7 . 1 +49.1 +46.3
Substituting this result into Eq. (3.2) gives:
or =
49.24
= 2.34~1-1.
9
Therefore, from 10 repeated measurements, the lysine concentration was 49.8 g 1-1 with standard deviation 2.3 g 1-1.
Methods for combining standard deviations in calculations
are discussed elsewhere [1, 2]. Remember that standard statis-
tical analysis does not account for systematic error; parameters
such as the mean and standard deviation are useful only if the
error in measurements is random. The effect of systematic error
cannot be minimised using standard statistical analysis or by col-
lecting repeated measurements.
3.2 Presentation of Experimental Data
Experimental data are often collected to examine relationships
between variables. The role of these variables in the experimental
process is clearly defined. Dependent variables or responsevariables
are uncontrolled during the experiment; dependent variables are
measured as they respond to changes in one or more independent
variables which are controlled or fixed. For example, ifwe wanted
to determine how UV radiation affects the frequency of muta-
tion in a culture, radiation dose would be the independent
variable and number of mutants the dependent variable.
There are three general methods for presenting data:
(i) tables;
(ii) graphs; and
(iii) equations.3 Presentation and Analysis of Data
31
Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Tables listing data
have highest accuracy, but can easily become too long and the
overall result or trend of the data cannot be readily visualised.
Graphs or plots of data create immediate visual impact since
relationships between variables are represented directly.
Graphs also allow easy interpolation of data, which can be dif-
ficult with tables. By convention, independent variables are
plotted along the abscissa (the X-axis), while one or more
dependent variables are plotted along the ordinate (Y-axis).
Plots show at a glance the general pattern of data, and can help
identify whether there are anomalous points; it is good prac-
tice to plot raw experimental data as they are being measured.
In addition, graphs can be used directly for quantitative data
analysis.
Physical phenomena can be represented using equations or
mathematical models; for example, balanced growth of micro-
organisms is described using the model:
x = Xoet4t
(3.3)
where x is the cell concentration at time t, x0 is the initial cell
concentration, and/, is the specific growth rate. Mathematical
models can be either mechanistic or empirical. Mechanistic
models are founded on theoretical assessment of the phen-
omenon being measured. An example is the Michaelis-
Menten equation for enzyme reaction:
/.2 --
~max $
Km+s
(3.4)
where v is rate of reaction, Vmax is maximum rate of reaction,
Km is the Michaelis constant, and s is substrate concentration.
The Michaelis-Menten equation is based on a loose analysis of
reactions supposed to occur during simple enzyme catalysis.
On the other hand, empirical models are used when no theoret-
ical hypothesis can be postulated. Empirical models may be
the only feasible option for correlating data from complicated
processes. As an example, the following correlation has been
developed to relate the power required to stir aerated liquids to
that required in non-aerated systems:
-0.25
pg - 0 . 1 0 ( ~ F g
P0
N
D 4
)-0.20
g W i V 2/3
(3.5)
In Eq. (3.5) /'g is power consumption with sparging, P0 is
power consumption without sparging, F is volumetric gas
flow rate, N i is stirrer speed, Vis liquid volume, D i is impeller
diameter, g is gravitational acceleration, and W i is impeller
blade width. There is no easy theoretical explanation for this
relationship; the equation is based on many observations using
different impellers, gas flow rates and rates of stirring.
Equations such as Eq. (3.5) are a short, concise means for com-
municating the results of a large number of experiments.
However, they are one step removed from the raw data and
can be only an approximate representation of all the informa-
tion collected.
3.3 Data Analysis
Once experimental data are collected, what we do with them
depends on the information being sought. Data are generally
collected for one or more of the following reasons:
(i)
to visualise the general trend of influence of one variable
on another;
(ii) to test the applicability of a particular model to a process;
(iii) to estimate the value of coefficients in process models;
and
(iv) to develop new empirical models.
Analysis of data would be enormously simplified if each datum
point did not contain error. For example, after an experiment
in which the apparent viscosity of a mycelial broth is measured
as a function of temperature, if all points on a plot of viscosity
versus temperature lay perfectly along a line and there were no
scatter, it would be very easy to determine unequivocally the
relationship between the variables. In reality, however, proce-
dures for data analysis must be closely linked with statistical
mathematics to account for random errors in measurement.
Despite their importance, detailed description of statistical
analysis is beyond the scope of this book; there are entire texts
devoted to the subject. Rather than presenting methods for
data analysis as such, the following sections discuss some of the
ideas behind interpretation of experiments. Once the general
approach is understood, the actual procedures involved can be
obtained from the references listed at the end of this chapter.
As we shall see, interpreting experimental data requires a
great deal of judgement and sometimes involves difficult deci-
sions. Nowadays most scientists and engineers have access to
computers or calculators equipped with software for data pro-
cessing. These facilities are very convenient and have removed
much of the tedium associated with statistical analysis. There
is a danger, however, that software packages are applied with-
out appreciation of inherent assumptions in the analysis or its
mathematical limitations. Thus, the user cannot know how
valuable or otherwise are the generated results.3 Presentation and Analysis of Data
3z
As already mentioned in Section 3.1.4, standard statistical
methods consider only random error, not systematic error. In
practical terms, this means that most procedures for data pro-
cessing are unsuitable when errors are due to poor instrument
calibration, repetition of the same mistakes in measurement,
or preconceived ideas about the expected result. All effort must
be made to eliminate these types of error before treating the
data. As also noted in Section 3.1.4, the reliability of results
from statistical analysis improves if many readings are taken.
No amount of sophisticated mathematical or other type of
manipulation can make up for sparse, inaccurate data.
3.3.1
Trends
Consider the data plotted in Figure 3.1 representing con-
sumption of glucose during batch culture of plant cells. If
there were serious doubt about the trend of the data we could
present the plot as a scatter of individual points without any
lines drawn through them. Sometimes data are simply con-
nected using line segments as shown in Figure 3.1(a); the
problem with this representation is that it suggests that the ups
and downs of glucose concentration are real. If, as with these
data, we are assured there is a progressive downward trend in
sugar concentration despite the occasional apparent increase,
we should smooth the data by drawing a curve through the
points as shown in Figure 3. l(b). Smoothing moderates the
effects of experimental error. By drawing a particular curve we
are indicating that, although the scatter of points is consider-
able, we believe the actual behaviour of the system is smooth
and continuous, and that all of the data without experimental
error would lie on that line. Usually there is great flexibility as
to where the smoothing curve is placed, and several questions
arise. To which points should the curve pass closest? Should all
the data points be included, or are some points clearly in error?
It soon becomes apparent that many equally-acceptable curves
can be drawn through the data.
Various techniques are available for smoothing. A smooth
line can be drawn freehand or with French or flexible curves
and other drafting equipment; this is called hand smoothing.
Procedures for minimising bias during hand smoothing can be
applied; some examples are discussed further in Chapter 11.
The danger involved in smoothing manually: that we tend to
smooth the expected response into the data, is well recognised.
Another method is to use a computer software package; this is
called machine smoothing. Computer routines, by smoothing
data according to pre-programmed mathematical or statistical
principles, eliminate the subjective element but are still
capable of introducing bias into the results. For example,
abrupt changes in the trend of data are generally not
recognised by statistical analysis. The advantage of hand
smoothing is that judgements about the significance of indi-
vidual data points can be taken into account.
Choice of curve is critical if smoothed data are to be applied
in subsequent analysis. The data of Figure 3.1 may be used to
calculate the rate of glucose consumption as a function of
time; procedures for this type of analysis are described further
in Chapter 11. In rate analysis, different smoothing curves
can lead to significantly different results. Because final

interpretation of the data depends on decisions made during
smoothing, it is important to minimise any errors introduced.
One obvious way of doing this is to take as many readings as
possible; when smooth curves are drawn through too few
points it is very difficult to justify the smoothing process.
3.3.2
Testing Mathematical
Models
Most applications of data analysis involve correlating meas-
ured data with existing mathematical models. The model
proposes some functional relationship between two or more
variables; our primary objective is to compare the properties of
the model with those of the experimental system.
As an example, consider Figure 3.2 which shows the results
from experiments in which rates of heat production and oxy-
gen consumption are measured for several microbial cultures
[6]. Although there is considerable scatter in these data we
could be led to believe that the relationship between rate of
heat production and rate of oxygen consumption is linear, as
indicated by the straight line in Figure 3.2. However there is
an infinite number ofways to represent any set of data; how do
we know that this linear relationship is the best? For instance
we might consider whether the data could be fitted by the
curve shown in Figure 3.3. This non-linear, oscillating model
seems to follow the data reasonably well; should we conclude
that there is a more complex non-linear relationship between
heat production and oxygen consumption?
Ultimately, we cannot know if a particular relationship
holds between variables. This is because we can only test a
selection of possible relationships and determine which of
them fits closest to the data. We can determine which model,
linear or oscillating, is the better representation of the data in
Figure 3.2, but we can never conclude that the relationship
between the variables is actually linear or oscillating. This
fundamental limitation of data analysis has important conse-
quences and must be accommodated in our approach. We
must start offwith a hypothesis about how the parameters are
related and use data to determine whether this hypothesis is
supported. A basic tenet in the philosophy of science is that it
is only possible to disprove hypotheses by showing that experi-
mental data do not conform to the model. The idea that the
primary business of science is to falsify theories, not verify

them, was developed this century by Austrian philosopher,
Karl Popper. Popper's philosophical excursions into the
meaning of scientific truth make extremely interesting read-
ing, e.g. [7, 8]; his theories have direct application in analysis
of measured data. We can never deduce with absolute cer-
tainty the physical relationships between variables using
experiments. Language used to report the results of data analy-
sis must reflect these limitations; particular models used to
correlate data cannot be described as 'correct' or 'true'
descriptions of the system, only 'satisfactory' or 'adequate' for
our purposes and measurement precision.
3.3.3 Goodness of Fit: Least-Squares Analysis
Determining how well data conform to a particular model
requires numerical procedures. Generally, these techniques
rely on measurement of the deviations or residuals of each
datum point from the curve or line representing the model
being tested. For example, residuals after correlating cell plas-
mid content with growth rate using a linear model are shown
by the dashed lines in Figure 3.4. A curve or line producing
small residuals is considered a good fit of the data.
A popular technique for locating the line or curve which
minimises the residuals is least-squares analysis. This statistical
procedure is based on minimising the sum ofsquares ofthe residu-
ah. There are several variations of the procedure: Legendre's
method minimises the sum-of-squares of residuals of the depen-
dent variable; Gauss's and Laplace's methods minimise the sum
of squares of weighted residuals where the weighting factors
depend on the scatter of replicate data points. Each method
gives different results; it should be remembered that the curve of
'best' fit is ultimately a matter of opinion. For example, by mini-
mising the sum of squares of the residuals, least-squares analysis
could produce a curve which does not pass close to particular
data points known beforehand to be more accurate than the rest.
Alternatively, we could choose to define the best fit as that which
minimises the absolute values of the residuals, or the sum of the
residuals raised to the fourth power. The decision to use the sum
of squares is an arbitrary one; many alternative approaches are
equally valid mathematically.
As well as minimising the residuals, other factors must be
taken into account when correlating data. First, the curve used
to fit the data should create approximately equal numbers of
positive and negative residuals. As shown in Figure 3.4(a),
when there are more positive than negative deviations from
the points, even though the sum of the residuals is relatively
small, the line representing the data cannot be considered a
good fit. The fit is also poor when, as shown in Figure 3.4(b),
all the positive residuals occur at low values of the independent
variable while the negative residuals occur at high values.
There should be no significant correlation of the residuals with
either the dependent or independent variable. The best3 Presentation and Analysis of Data

Some data sets contain one or more points which deviate
substantially from predicted values, more than is expected
from 'normal' random experimental error. These points
known as 'outliers' have large residuals and, therefore, strongly
influence regression methods using the sum-of-squares
approach. It is usually inappropriate to eliminate outliers; they
may be legitimate experimental results reflecting the true
behaviour of the system and could be explained and fitted
using an alternative model not yet considered. The best way to
handle outliers is to analyse the data with and without the
aberrant values to make sure their elimination does not influ-
ence discrimination between models. It must be emphasised
that only one point at a time and only very rare data points, if
any, should be eliminated from data sets.
Measuring individual residuals and applying least-squares
analysis would be very useful in determining which of the two
curves in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 fits the data more closely.
However, as well as mathematical considerations, other factors
can influence choice of model for experimental data. Consider
again the data of Figures 3.2 and 3.3. Unless the fit obtained
with the oscillatory model were very much improved com-
pared with the linear model, we might prefer the straight-line
correlation because it is simple, and because it conforms with
what we know about microbial metabolism and the thermo-
dynamics of respiration. It is difficult to find a credible
theoretical justification for representing the relationship with
an oscillating curve, so we could be persuaded to reject the
non-linear model even though it fits the data reasonably well.
Choosing between models on the basis of supposed mech-
anism requires a great deal of judgement. Since we cannot
know for sure what the relationship is between the two param-
eters, choosing between models on the basis of supposed
mechanism brings in an element of bias. This type of pre-
sumptive judgement is the reason why it is so difficult to
overturn established scientific theories; even if data are avail-
able to support a new hypothesis there is a tendency to reject it
because it does not agree with accepted theory. Nevertheless, if
we wanted to fly in the face of convention and argue that an
oscillatory relationship between rates of heat evolution and
oxygen consumption is more reasonable than a straight-line
relationship, we would undoubtedly have to support our claim
with more evidence than the data shown in Figure 3.3.
1.5
Specific growth rate (h -l)
straight-line fit is shown in Figure 3.4(c); the residuals are rela-
tively small, well distributed in both positive and negative
directions, and there is no relationship between the residuals
and either variable.
3.3.4 Linear and Non-Linear Models
A straight line is represented by the equation:
y=Ax+B.
(3.6)3 Presentation and Analysis of Data
36
B is the intercept of the straight line on the ordinate; A is the
slope. A and B are also called the coefficients, parameters or
adjustable parameters of Eq. (3.6). Once a straight line is
drawn, A is found by taking any two points (x 1, Yl) and (x2, Y2)
on the line, and calculating:
A=
%-Yl)
(x 2 - xl)"
(3.7)
As indicated in Figure 3.5, (x l, Yl) and (x2, Y2) are points on the
line through the data; they are not measured data values. Once
A is known, B is calculated as:
or
B =yl - A xI
B = y 2 - A x 2.
(3.8)
Suppose we measure n pairs of values of two variables x and y,
and a plot of the dependent variable y versus the independent
variable xsuggests a straight-line relationship. In testing corre-
lation of the data with Eq. (3.6), changing the values of A and
Bwill affect how well the model fits the data. Values of A and B
giving the best straight line are determined by linear regression
or linear least-squares analysis. This procedure is one of the
most frequently used in data analysis; linear-regression rou-
tines are part of many computer packages and are available on
hand-held calculators. Linear regression methods fit data by
finding the straight line which minimises the sum of squares of
the residuals. Details of the method can be found in statistics
texts [5, 9, 10].
Because linear regression is so accessible, it can be readily
applied without proper regard for its appropriateness or the
assumptions incorporated in its method. Unless the following

points are considered before using regression analysis, biased
estimates of parameter values will be obtained.
(i)
Least-squares analysis applies only to data containing
random error.
'(ii) The variables x a n d y m u s t be independent.
(iii) Simple linear-regression methods are restricted to the
special case of all uncertainty being associated with one
variable. If the analysis uses a regression ofy on x, then y
should be the variable involving the largest errors. More
complicated techniques are required to deal with errors in
x and y simultaneously.
(iv) Simple linear-regression methods assume that each data
point has equal significance. Modified procedures must
be used if some points are considered more or less import-
ant than others, or if the line must pass through some
specified point, e.g. the origin. It is also assumed that each
point is equally precise, i.e. the standard deviation or ran-
dom error associated with individual readings is the same.
In experiments, the degree of fluctuation in the response
variable often changes within the range of interest; for
example, measurements may be more or less affected by
instrument noise at the high or low end of the scale, so
that data collected at the beginning of an experiment will
have different errors compared with those measured at
the end. Under these conditions, simple least-squares
analysis is not appropriate.
(v) As already mentioned with respect to Figures 3.4(a) and
3.4(b), positive and negative residuals should be approxi-
mately evenly distributed, and residuals should be
independent of both xand y variables.
Correlating data with straight lines is a relatively easy form
of data analysis. When experimental data deviate markedly
from a straight line, correlation using non-linear models is
required. It is usually more difficult to decide which model to
test and obtain parameter values when data do not follow
linear relationships. As an example, consider growth of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, which is expected to follow the
non-linear model of Eq. (3.3). We could attempt to check
whether measured cell-concentration data are consistent with
Eq. (3.3) by plotting the values on linear graph paper as shown
in Figure 3.6(a). The data appear to exhibit an exponential
response typical of simple growth kinetics but it is not clear
that an exponential model is appropriate. It is also difficult to
ascertain some of the finer points of culture behaviour; for
instance, whether the initial points represent a lag phase or
whether exponential growth commenced immediately.
Furthermore, the value of/1 for this culture is not readily dis-
cernible from Figure 3.6(a).3 Presentation and Analysis of Data

A convenient graphical approach to this problem is to
transform the model equation into a linear form. Following
the rules for logarithms outlined in Appendix D, taking the
natural logarithm of both sides of Eq (3.3) gives:
lnx=
l n x o + W.
(3.9)
Eq. (3.9) indicates a linear relationship between In x and t,
with intercept In x0 and slope/1. Accordingly, if Eq. (3.3) is a
good model of yeast growth, a plot of the natural logarithm of
cell concentration versus time should, during the growth
phase, yield a straight line. Results of this linear transformation
are shown in Figure 3.6(b). All points before stationary phase
appear to lie on a straight line suggesting absence of a lag
phase; the value of/~ is readily calculated from the slope of the
line. Graphical linearisation has the advantage that gross
deviations from the model are immediately evident upon vis-
ual inspection. Other non-linear relationships and suggested
methods for yielding straight-line plots are given in Table 3.1.
Once data have been transformed to produce straight lines,
it is tempting to apply linear least-squares analysis to deter-
mine the model parameters. We could enter the values of time
and logarithms of cell concentration into a computer or calcu-
lator programmed for linear regression. This analysis would
give us the straight line through the data which minimises the
sum-of-squares of the residuals. Most users of linear regression
choose this technique because they believe it will automatical-
ly give them an objective and unbiased analysis of their data.
However, application of linear least-squares analysis to linearised
data can result in biased estimates of model parameters. The
reason is related to the assumption in least-squares analysis
that each datum point has equal random error associated with
it.
When data are linearised, the error structure is changed so
that distribution of errors becomes biased [11, 12]. Although
standard deviations for each raw datum point may be approxi-
mately constant over the range of measurement, when
logarithms are calculated, the error associated with each datum
point becomes dependent on its magnitude. This also happens
when data are inverted, as in some of the transformations sug-
gested in Table 3.1. Small errors in y lead to enormous errors
in 1/y when y is small; for large values ofy the same errors are
barely noticeable in lly. This effect is shown in Figure 3.7; the
error bars represent a constant error in y of _+0.05 y'. When
the magnitude of errors after transformation is dependent on
the value of the variable, simple least-squares analysis should
not be used.
In such cases, modifications must be made to the analysis.
One alternative is to apply weighted least-squares techniques.
The usual way of doing this is to take replicate measurements
of the variable, transform the data, calculate the standard
deviations for the transformed variable, and then weight the
values by 1/c2. Correctly weighted linear regression often gives
satisfactory parameter values for non-linear models; details of
the procedures can be found elsewhere [2, 9].
Techniques of non-linear regression usually give better
results than weighted linear regression. In non-linear regres-
sion, equations such as those in Table 3.1 are fitted directly to
the data. However, determining an optimal set of parameters
by non-linear regression can be difficult and reliability of the
results more difficult to interpret. The most common non-linear3 Presentation and Analysis of Data

3.4 Graph Paper With Logarithmic
Coordinates
Two frequently-occurring non-linear functions are the power
law, y = B x A, and the exponential function, y = B e Ax. These
relationships are often presented using graph paper with
logarithmic coordinates. Before proceeding, it may be
necessary for you to review the mathematical rules for log-
arithms outlined in Appendix D.

When plotted on a linear scale, some data have the form of
either 1, 2 or 3 in Figure 3.8(a), all of which are not straight
lines. Note also that none of these curves intersects either axis
except at the origin. If straight-line representation is required,
we must transform the data by calculating logarithms; plots of
log or In x versus log or In y yield straight lines as shown in
Figure 3.8(b). The best straight line through the data can be
estimated using suitable non-linear regression analysis as dis-
cussed in Section 3.3.4.
When there are many data points, calculating the loga-
rithms o f x a n d y c a n be very time-consuming. An alternative is
to use log-log graph paper. The raw data, not logarithms, are
plotted directly on log-log paper; the resulting graph is as if
logarithms were calculated to base e. Graph paper with both
axes scaled logarithmically is shown in Figure 3.9; each axis in
this example covers two logarithmic cycles. On log-log plots3 Presentation and Analysis of Data

Inspection of Eq. (3.10) shows that, ifA is positive, y = 0 when
x = 0. Therefore, a positive value of A corresponds to either
curve 1 or 2 passing through the origin of Figure 3.8(a). IfA is
negative, when x = 0, y is infinite; therefore, negative A corre-
sponds to curve 3 in Figure 3.8(a) which is asymptotic to both
linear axes.

as follows. A can be calculated in two ways:

equation:

If the log-log graph paper is drawn so that the ordinate
and abscissa scales are the same, i.e. the distance measured
with a ruler for a 10-fold change in the y variable is the
same as for a 10-fold change in the x variable, A is the
actual slope of the line. A is obtained by taking two points
(Xl, Yl) and (x2, Y2) on the line, and measuring the dis-
tances between Y2 and Yl and x2 and x 1 with a ruler:

coordinates of two points on the line, (x 1, Yl) and (x2, Y2)'
and making the calculation:3 Presentation and Analysis of Data

An alternative to calculating logarithms is a semi-log plot,

x2 - 10.6 g l - 1) fall on a straight line passing through the data.
(a) Determine the equation relating xand t.
(b) What is the value of the specific growth rate for this culture?
Solution:
(a) A straight line on semi-log graph paper means that x and t are correlated with the equation x - B e At A and B are calculated
from Eqs (3.17) and (3.18):

- 0.076
and
In B = In 10.6 - (0.076) (15) = 1.215
or
B = 3.37.
Therefore, the equation for cell concentration as a function of time is:
x - 3.37e ~176 t
This result should be checked, for example, by substituting t I = 0.5:
B e At' = 3.37e (~176176 = 3.5 = x 1.

3.5 General Procedures For Plotting Data
Axes on plots must be labelled for the graph to carry any mean-
ing. The units associated with all physical variables should be
stated explicitly. If more than one curve is plotted on a single
graph, each curve must be identified with a label.
It is good practice to indicate the precision of data on
graphs using error bars. As an example, Table 3.2 lists values of
monoclonal-antibody concentration as a function of medium
flow rate during continuous culture of hybridoma cells in a
stirred fermenter. The flow rate was measured to within • 0.02
litres per day. Measurement of antibody concentration was
more difficult and somewhat imprecise; these values are esti-
mated to involve errors of • 10 lag ml-1. Errors associated
with the data are indicated in Figure 3.12 using error bars to
show the possible range of each variable.

3.6 Process Flow Diagrams
This chapter is concerned with ways of presenting and
analysing data. Because of the complexity of large-scale manu-
facturing processes, communicating information about these
systems requires special methods. Flow diagrams or flow sheets
are simplified pictorial representations of processes and are
used to present relevant process information and data. Flow
sheets vary in complexity from simple block diagrams to high-
ly complex schematic drawings showing main and auxiliary
process equipment such as pipes, valves, pumps and by-pass
loops.
Figure 3.13 is a simplified process flow diagram showing
the major operations for production of the antibiotic, bacitra-
cin. This qualitative flow sheet indicates the flow of materials,
the sequence of process operations, and the principal equip-
ment in use. When flow diagrams are applied in calculations,
the operating conditions, masses and concentrations of
material handled by the process are also specified. An example
is Figure 3.14, which represents recovery operations for
2,3-butanediol produced commercially by fermentation of
whole wheat mash. The quantities and compositions of

streams undergoing processes such as distillation, evaporation,
screening and drying are shown to allow calculation of prod-
uct yields and energy costs.
Detailed engineering flowsheets such as Figure 3.15 are
useful for plant construction work and trouble-shooting
because they show all piping, valves, drains, pumps and safety
equipment. Standard symbols are adopted to convey the infor-
mation as concisely as possible. Figure 3.15 represents a
pilot-scale fermenter with separate vessels for antifoam, acid
and alkali. All air, medium inlet and harvest lines are shown, as
are the steam and condensate-drainage lines for in situ steam
sterilisation of the entire apparatus.
In addition to those illustrated here, other specialised types
of flow diagram are used to specify instrumentation for process
control networks in large-scale processing plants, and for util-
ities such as steam, water, fuel and air supplies. We will not be
applying complicated or detailed diagrams such as Figure 3.15
in our analysis of bioprocessing; their use is beyond the scope
of this book. However, simplified versions of flow diagrams
are extremely useful, especially for material- and energy-
balance calculations; we will be applying block diagram flow
sheets in Chapters 4-6 for this purpose. You should become
familiar with flow diagrams for showing data and other process
information.

Material Balances
One of the simplest concepts in process engineering is the material or mass balance. Because mass in biological systems is
conserved at all times, the law of conservation of mass provides the theoretical~amework for material balances.
In steady-state material balances, masses entering a process are summed up and compared with the total mass leaving the
system; the term "balance'implies that masses entering and leaving should be equal Essentially, material balances are
accountingprocedures: total mass entering must be accounted for at the end of theprocess, even i f it undergoes heating,
mixing, drying, fermentation or any other operation (except nuclear reaction) within the system. Usually it is not feasible to
measure the masses and compositions of all streams entering and leaving a system; unknown quantities can be calculated using
mass-balanceprinciples. Mass-balanceproblems have a constant iheme: given the masses of some input and output streams,
calculate the masses of others.
Mass balances provide a very powerful tool in engineering
analysis. Many complex situations are simplified by looking at
the movement of mass and equating what comes out to what
goes in. Questions such as: what is the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the fermenter off-gas? what fraction of the substrate
consumed is not converted into products? how much reactant
is needed to produce x grams of product? how much oxygen
must be provided for this fermentation to proceed? can be
answered using mass balances. This chapter explains how the
law of conservation of mass is applied to atoms, molecular
species and total mass, and sets up formal techniques for solv-
ing material-balance problems with and without reaction.
Aspects of metabolic stoichiometry are also discussed for cal-
culation of nutrient and oxygen requirements during
fermentation processes.real and tangible, such as the walls of a beaker or fermenter, or
imaginary. If the boundary does not allow mass to pass from
system to surroundings and vice versa, the system is a closed
system with constant mass. Conversely, a system able to
exchange mass with its surroundings is an open system.
A process causes changes in the system or surroundings.
Several terms are commonly used to describe processes.
4.1 Thermodynamic PreliminariesFigure 4.1
Thermodynamics is a fundamental branch of science dealing
with the properties of matter. Thermodynamic principles are
useful in setting up material balances; some terms borrowed
from thermodynamics are defined below.
4.1.1
System and Process
In thermodynamics, a system consists of any matter identified
for investigation. As indicated in Figure 4.1, the system is set
apart from the surroundings, which are the remainder of the
universe, by a system boundary. The system boundary may be

are added to the system at the start of the process; the
system is then closed and products removed only when
the process is complete.

but not output.
(iv) A continuous process allows matter to flow in and out of
the system. If rates of mass input and output are equal,
continuous processes can be operated indefinitely.change in both the system and the universe can occur. Large-
scale equilibrium does not often occur in engineering systems;
steady states are more common.
4.1.2 Steady State and EquilibriumMass is conserved in ordinary chemical and physical processes.
Consider the system of Figure 4.2 operating as a continuous
process with input and output streams containing glucose.
The mass flow rate ofglucose into the system is M i kg h-I; the
mass flow rate out is 117/0kg h -1. If AT'/iand 571o are different,
there are four possible explanations:
If all properties of a system, such as temperature, pressure,
concentration, volume, mass, etc. do not vary with time, the
process is said to be at steady state. Thus, if we monitor any
variable of a steady-state system, its value will be unchanging
with time.
According to this definition of steady state, batch, fed-
batch and semi-batch processes cannot operate under
steady-state conditions. Mass of the system is either increasing
or decreasing with time during fed-batch and semi-batch pro-
cesses; in batch processes, even though the total mass is
constant, changes occurring inside the system cause the system
properties to vary with time. Such processes are called transient
or unsteady-state processes. On the other hand, continuous
processes may be either steady state or transient. It is usual to
run continuous processes as close to steady state as possible;
however, unsteady-state conditions will exist during start-up
and for some time after any change in operating conditions.
Steady state is an important and useful concept in engineer-
ing analysis. However, it is often confused with another
thermodynamic term, equilibrium. A system at equilibrium is
one in which all opposing forces are exactly counter-balanced
so that the properties of the system do not change with time.
From experience we know that systems tend to approach an
equilibrium condition when they are isolated from their sur-
roundings. At equilibrium there is no net change in either the
system or the universe. Equilibrium implies that there is no net
driving force for change; the energy of the system is at a mini-
mum and, in rough terms, the system is 'static', 'unmoving' or
'inert'. For example, when liquid and vapour are in equilib-
rium in a closed vessel, although there may be constant
exchange of molecules between the phases, there is no net
change in either the system or the surroundings.
To convert raw materials into useful products there must
be an overall change in the universe. Because systems at equi-
librium produce no net change, equilibrium is of little value in
processing operations. The best strategy is to avoid equilib-
rium by continuously disturbing the system in such a way that
raw material will always be undergoing transformation into
the desired product. In continuous processes at steady state,
mass is constantly exchanged with the surroundings; this dis-
turbance drives the system away from equilibrium so that a net

(i) measurements of/Qi and 117/0are wrong;
(ii) the system has a leak allowing glucose to enter or escape
undetected;
(iii) glucose is consumed or generated by chemical reaction
within the system; or
(iv) glucose accumulates within the system.
If we assume that the measurements are correct and there are
no leaks, the difference between AT'/i and 117/0must be due to
consumption or generation by reaction, and/or accumulation.
A mass balance for the system can be written in a general way
to account for these possibilities:

The accumulation term in the above equation can be either
positive or negative; negative accumulation represents deple-
tion of pre-existing reserves. Eq. (4.1) is known as the general
mass-balance equation. The mass referred to in the equation
can be total mass, mass of a particular molecular or atomic spe-
cies, or biomass. Use of Eq. (4.1) is illustrated in Example 4.1.

General mass-balance equation
A continuous process is set up for treatment of wastewater. Each day, 10 5 kg cellulose and 10 3 kg bacteria enter in the feed
stream, while 10 4 kg cellulose and 1.5 x 10 4 kg bacteria leave in the effluent. The rate of cellulose digestion by the bacteria is 7 x
10 4 kg d -1. The rate of bacterial growth is 2 x 10 4 kg d - l ; the rate of cell death by lysis is 5 x 10 2 kg d -1. Write balances for
cellulose and bacteria in the system.
Solution:
Cellulose is not generated by the process, only consumed. Using a basis of 1 day, the cellulose balance in kg from Eq. (4.1) is:
(10 5 - 10 4 + 0 - 7 • 10 4) = accumulation.
Therefore, 2 x 10 4 kg cellulose accumulates in the system each day.
Performing the same balance for bacteria:
(10 3 - 1.5 x 10 4 + 2 x 10 4 -- 5 X 1 0 2) = accumulation.
Therefore, 5.5 x 10 3 kg bacterial cells accumulate in the system each day.
4.2.1
Types of Material
Balance
The general mass-balance equation (4.1) can be applied with
equal ease to two different types of mass-balance problem,
depending on the data provided. For continuous processes it is
usual to collect information about the process referring to a
particular instant in time. Amounts of mass entering and leav-
ing the system are specified using flow rates, e.g. molasses
enters the system at a rate of 50 lb h - 1; at the same instant in
time, fermentation broth leaves at a rate of 20 lb h-1. These
two quantities can be used directly in Eq. (4.1) as the input
and output terms. A mass balance based on rates is called a
differential balance.
An alternative approach is required for batch and semi-
batch processes. Information about these systems is usually
collected over a period of time rather than at a particular
instant. For example: 100 kg substrate is added to the reactor;
after 3 days' incubation, 45 kg product is recovered. Each term
of the mass-balance equation in this case is a quantity of mass,
not a rate. This type of balance is called an integral balance.
In this chapter, we will be using differential balances for
continuous systems operating at steady state, and integral bal-
ances for batch and semi-batch systems between initial and
final states. Calculation procedures for the two types of
material balance are very similar.
4.2.2
Simplification
o f the General
Mass-Balance Equation
Eq. (4.1) can be simplified in certain situations. If a
continuous process is at steady state, the accumulation term
on the right-hand side must be zero. This follows from the def-
inition of steady state: because all properties of the system,
including its mass, must be unchanging with time, a system at
steady state cannot accumulate mass. Under these conditions,
Eq. (4.1) becomes:
mass in + mass generated = mass out + mass consumed.
(4.2)
Eq. (4.2) is called the general steady-state mass-balance equa-
tion. Eq. (4.2) also applies over the entire duration of batch
and fed-batch processes; 'mass out' in this case is the total mass
harvested from the system so that at the end of the process
there is no accumulation.
If reaction does not occur in the system, or if the mass bal-
ance is applied to a substance that is neither a reactant nor
product of reaction, the generation and consumption terms in
Eqs (4.1) and (4.2) are zero. Because total mass can be neither
created nor destroyed except in nuclear reaction, generation
and consumption terms must also be zero in balances applied
to total mass. Similarly, generation and consumption of atom-
ic species such as C, N, O, etc. cannot occur in normal
chemical reaction. Therefore at steady state, for balances on
total mass or atomic species or when reaction does not occur,
Eq. (4.2) can be further simplified to:
mass in = mass out.
(4.3)4 Material Balances

Table 4.1 summarises the types of material balance for which
direct application of Eq. (4.3) is valid. Because total number of
moles does not balance in systems with reaction, we will carry
out all material balances using mass.

4.3 Procedure For Material-Balance
Calculations
The first step in material-balance calculations is to understand
the problem. Certain information is available about a process;
the task is to calculate unknown quantities. Because it is some-
times difficult to sort through all the details provided, it is best
to use standard procedures to translate process information
into a form that can be used in calculations.
Material balances should be carried out in an organised
manner; this makes the solution easy to follow, check, or use
by others. In this chapter, a formalised series of steps is fol-
lowed for each mass-balance problem. For easier problems
these procedures may seem long-winded and unnecessary;
however a standard method is helpful when you are first learn-
ing mass-balance techniques. The same procedures are used in
the next chapter as a basis for energy balances.
These points are essential.
Draw a clearprocessflow diagram showing all relevant infor-
mation. A simple box diagram showing all streams entering
or leaving the system allows information about a process to
be organised and summarised in a convenient way. All
given quantitative information should be shown on the
diagram. Note that the variables of interest in material bal-
ances are masses, mass flow rates and mass compositions; if
information about particular streams is given using volume
or molar quantities, mass flow rates and compositions
should be calculated before labelling the flow sheet.
(ii) Select a set of units and state it clearly. Calculations are
(i)
easier when all quantities are expressed using consistent
units. Units must also be indicated for all variables shown
on process diagrams.
(iii) Select a basis for the calculation and state it clearly. In
approaching mass-balance problems it is helpful to focus
on a specific quantity of material entering or leaving the
system. For continuous processes at steady state we usual-
ly base the calculation on the amount of material entering
or leaving the system within a specified period of time.
For batch or semi-batch processes, it is convenient to use
either the total amount of material fed to the system or
the amount withdrawn at the end. Selection of a basis for
calculation makes it easier to visualise the problem; the
way this works will become apparent in the worked
examples of the next section.
(iv) State allassumptions applied to theproblem. To solve prob-
lems in this and the following chapters, you will need to
apply some 'engineering' judgement. Real-life situations
are complex, and there will be times when one or more
assumptions are required before you can proceed with
calculations. To give you experience with this, problems
posed in this text may not give you all the necessary
information. The details omitted can be assumed, pro-
vided your assumptions are reasonable. Engineers make
assumptions all the time; knowing when an assumption is
permissible and what constitutes a reasonable assump-
tion is one of the marks of a skilled engineer. When you
make assumptions about a problem it is vitally important
that you state them exactly. Other scientists looking
through your calculations need to know the conditions
under which your results are applicable; they will also
want to decide whether your assumptions are acceptable
or whether they can be improved.
In this chapter, differential mass balances on continuous
processes are performed with the understanding that the
system is at steady state; we can assume that mass flow rates
and compositions do not change with time and the accu-
mulation term of Eq. (4.1) is zero. If steady state does not
prevail in continuous processes, information about the rate
of accumulation would be required for solution of mass-
balance problems. This is discussed further in Chapter 6.
Another assumption we must make in mass-balance
problems is that the system under investigation does not
leak. In totalling up all the masses entering and leaving
the system, we must be sure that all streams are taken into
account. When analysing real systems it is always a good
idea to check for leaks before carrying out mass balances.
(v) Identify which components of the system, if any, are involved
in reaction. This is necessary for determining which mass-
balance equation (4.2) or (4.3), is appropriate. The4 Material Balances

Example 4.2 Setting up a flow sheet
Humid air enriched with oxygen is prepared for a gluconic acid fermentation. The air is prepared in a special humidifying
chamber. 1.5 I h - 1 liquid water enters the chamber at the same time as dry air and 15 gmol min- 1 dry oxygen gas. All the water
is evaporated. The outflowing gas is found to contain 1% (w/w) water. Draw and label the flow sheet for this process.
Solution:
Let us choose units ofg and min for this process; the information provided is first converted to mass flow rates in these units. The
density of water is taken to be 103 g 1-1; therefore:

4.4 Material-Balance Worked Examples
Procedures for setting out mass-balance calculations are out-
lined in this section. Although not the only way to attack these
problems, the method shown will assist your problem-solving
efforts by formalising the mathematical approach. Mass-
balance calculations are divided into four steps: assemble, ana-
lyse, calculate and finalise. Differential and integral mass
balances with and without reaction are illustrated below.4 Material Balances

slurry is fed to the filter; 1 kg slurry contains 60 g cell solids. To improve filtration rates, particles of diatomaceous-earth filter aid
are added at a rate of 10 kg h- 1. The concentration ofkanamycin in the slurry is 0.05% by weight. Liquid filtrate is collected at
a rate of 112 kg h-1; the concentration ofkanamycin in the filtrate is 0.045% (w/w). Filter cake containing cells and filter aid is
continuously removed from the filter cloth.
(a) What percentage liquid is the filter cake?
(b) If the concentration ofkanamycin in the filter-cake liquid is the same as in the filtrate, how much kanamycin is absorbed per
kg filter aid?

Calculate
Set up a calculation table showing all components of all streamspassing across system boundaries. State the units usedfor the
table. Enter all known quantities.
(i)
As shown in Figure 4E3.1, four streams cross the system boundaries: fermentation slurry, filter aid, filtrate and filter cake.
The components of these streams: cells, kanamycin, filter aid and water are represented in Table 4E3.1. The table is divided
into two major sections: In and Out. Masses entering or leaving the system each hour are shown in the table; the units used
are kg. Because filtrate and filter cake flow out of the system, there are no entries for these streams on the left hand-side of the
table. Conversely, there are no entries for fermentation slurry or filter aid on the O u t side of the table. The total mass of each
stream is given in the last column on each side of the table. The total amount of each component flowing in and out of the
system is shown in the last row. With all known quantities entered, several masses remain unknown; these quantities are
indicated by question marks.

(ii) Calculateunknown quantities, apply the mass-balance equation.
To complete Table 4E3.1, let us consider each row and column separately. In the row representing fermentation slurry, the
total mass of the stream is known as 120 kg and the masses of each component except water are known. The entry for water
can therefore be determined as the difference between 120 kg and the sum of the known components: (120 - 7.2 - 0.06 - 0)
kg - 112.74 kg. This mass for water has been entered in Table 4E3.2. The row for filter aid is already complete in Table
4E3.1; no cells or kanamycin are present in the diatomaceous earth, which we assume is dry. We can fill in the final row of
the In side of the table; numbers in this row are obtained by adding the values in each vertical column. The total mass of cells
input to the system in all streams is 7.2 kg, the total kanamycin entering is 0.06 kg, etc. The total mass of all components fed
into the system is the sum of the last column of the left-hand side: ( 120 + 10) kg - 130 kg. O n the O u t side, we can complete
the row for filtrate. We have assumed there are no solids such as cells or filter aid in the filtrate; therefore the mass of water in
the filtrate is (112 - 0.05) kg - 111.95 kg. As yet, the entire composition and mass of the filter cake remain unknown.4 Material Balances

To complete the table, we must consider the mass-balance equation relevant to this problem, Eq. (4.3). In the absence of
reaction, this equation can be applied to total mass and to the masses of each component of the system.
Total mass balance
130 kg total mass in - total mass out.
.'. Total mass out - 130 kg.
Cell balance
7.2 kg cells in - cells out.
.'. Cells out = 7.2 kg.
Kanamycin balance
0.06 kg kanamycin in - kanamycin out.
.'. Kanamycin o u t - 0.06 kg.
Filter-aM balance
10 kg filter aid in = filter aid out.
.'. Filter aid o u t - 10 kg.
Water balance
112.74 kg water in = water out.
.'. Water out = 112.74 kg.
These results are entered in the last row of the O u t side of Table 4E3.2; in the absence of reaction this row is always identi-
cal to the final row of In side. The c o m p o n e n t masses for filter cake can now be filled in as the difference between numbers
in the final row and the masses of each component in the filtrate. Take time to look over Table 4E3.2; you should under-
stand how all the numbers were obtained.
(iii) Check that your results are reasonable and make sense.
Mass-balance calculations must be checked. Make sure that all columns and rows of Table 4E3.2 add up to the totals
shown.
.
Finalise
(i) Answer the specific questions asked in theproblem.
The percentage liquid in the filter cake can be calculated from the results in Table 4E3.2. Dividing the mass of water in the
filter cake by the total mass of this stream, the percentage liquid is:
0.79 kg
18 kg
• 100 = 4.39%.4 Material Balances
59
i
If the concentration ofkanamycin in this liquid is only 0.045%, the mass ofkanamycin is very close to:
0.045
x 0.79 kg = 3.6 • 10 -4 kg.
100
However, we know from Table 4E3.2 that a total of 0.01 kg kanamycin is contained in the filter cake; therefore
(0.01 - 3.6 • 10 -4) kg = 0.0096 kg kanamycin is unaccounted for. Following our assumption that kanamycin is not
adsorbed by the cells, 0.0096 kg kanamycin must be retained by the filter aid. 10 kg filter aid is present; therefore the
kanamycin absorbed per kg filter aid is:
0.0096 kg
10 kg
= 9.6• 10-4kgkg -1.
(ii) State the answers clearly and unambiguously, checking significant figures.
(a) The liquid content of the filter cake is 4.4%.
(b) The amount ofkanamycin absorbed by the filter aid is 9.6 x 10 -4 kg kg- 1
Note in Example 4.3 that the complete composition of the fer-
mentation slurry was not provided. Cell and kanamycin
concentrations were given; however the slurry most probably
contained a Variety of other components such as residual car-
bohydrate, minerals, vitamins, amino acids and additional
fermentation products. These components were ignored in
the mass balance; the liquid phase of the slurry was considered
to be water only. This assumption is reasonable as the concen-
tration of dissolved substances in fermentation broths is
usually very small; water in spent broth usually accounts for
more than 90% of the liquid phase.
Note also in this problem that the masses of some of the
components were different by several orders of magnitude, e.g.
the mass of kanamycin in the filtrate was of the order 10 -2
whereas the total mass of this stream was of the order 102 .
Calculation of the mass of water by difference therefore
involved subtracting a very small number from a large one and
carrying more significant figures than warranted. This is an
unavoidable feature of most mass balances for biological pro-
cesses, which are characterised by dilute solutions, low product
concentrations and large amounts of water. However,
although excess significant figures were carried in the mass-
balance table, the final answers were reported with due regard
to data accuracy.
The above example illustrates mass-balance procedures for
a simple steady-state process without reaction. An integral
mass balance for a batch system without reaction is illustrated
in Example 4.4.
Example 4.4 Batch mixing
Corn-steep liquor contains 2.5 % invert sugars and 50% water; the rest can be considered solids. Beet molasses containing 50% sucrose,
1% invert sugars, 18% water and the remainder solids, is mixed with corn-steep liquor in a mixing tank. Water is added to produce a
diluted sugar mixture containing 2% (w/w) invert sugars. 125 kg corn-steep liquor and 45 kg molasses are fed into the tank.

acetic acid fermentation
Acetobacter aceti bacteria convert ethanol to acetic acid under aerobic conditions. A continuous fermentation process for vinegar
production is proposed using non-viable A. aceti cells immobilised on the surface of gelatin beads. The production target is
2 kg h - 1 acetic acid; however the maximum acetic acid concentration tolerated by the cells is 12%. Air is pumped into the fer-
menter at a rate of 200 gmol h - 1.

The mass-balance table with data provided is shown as Table 4E5.1; the units are kg. E t O H denotes ethanol; HAc is acetic
acid. If 2 kg acetic acid represents 12 mass% of the product stream, the total mass of the product stream must be 2/0.12 -
16.67 kg. If we assume complete conversion of ethanol, the only components of the product stream are acetic acid and
water; therefore water must account for 88 mass% of the product stream = 14.67 kg. In order to represent what is known
about the inlet air, some preliminary calculations are needed.

(i) The specific questions.
The ethanol required is 1.533 kg. The water required is 14.07 kg. The off-gas contains 0.277 kg 0 2 and 4.424 kg N 2.
Since gas compositions are normally expressed using volume or mole%, we must convert these values to moles:

(ii) Answers.
Quantities are expressed in kg h-1 rather than kg to reflect the continuous nature of the process and the basis used for
calculation.
(a) 1.5 kg h-1 ethanol is required.
(b) 14.1 kg h - 1water must be used to dilute the ethanol in the feed stream.
(c) The composition of the fermenter off-gas is 5.2% 0 2 and 94.8% N 2.
There are several points to note about the problem and cal-
culation of Example 4.5. First, cell growth and its requirement
for substrate were not considered because the cells used in this
process were non-viable. For fermentation with live cells,
growth and other metabolic activity must be taken into
account in the mass balance. This requires knowledge of
growth stoichiometry, which is considered in Example 4.6 and
discussed in more detail in Section 4.6. Use of non-growing4 Material Balances
immobilised cells in Example 4.5 meant that the cells were not
components of any stream flowing in or out of the process, nor
were they generated in reaction. Therefore, cell mass did not
have to be included in the calculation.
Example 4.5 illustrates the importance of phase separations.
Unreacted oxygen and nitrogen were assumed to leave the
system as off-gas rather than as components of the liquid prod-
uct stream. This assumption is reasonable due to the very poor
solubility of oxygen and nitrogen in aqueous liquids; although
the product stream most likely contains some dissolved gas, the
quantities are relatively small. This assumption may need to be
reviewed for gases with higher solubility, e.g. ammonia.
In the above problem, nitrogen did not react, nor were
there more than one stream in and one stream out carrying
nitrogen. A material which goes directly from one stream to
another is called a tie component; the mass balance for a tie
component is relatively simple. Tie components are useful
because they can provide partial solutions to mass-balance
67
problems making subsequent calculations easier. More than
one tie component may be present in a particular process.
One of the listed aisumptions in Example 4.5 is rapid oxy-
gen transfer. Because cells use oxygen in dissolved form,
oxygen must be transferred into the liquid phase from gas bub-
bles supplied to the fermenter. The speed of this process
depends on the culture conditions and operation of the fer-
menter as described in more detail in Chapter 9. In
mass-balance problems we assume that all oxygen required by
the stoichiometric equation is immediately available to the
cells.
Sometimes it is not possible to solve for unknown quan-
tities in mass balances until near the end of the calculation. In
such cases, symbols for various components rather than
numerical values must be used in the balance equations. This
is illustrated in the integral mass-balance of Example 4.6
which analyses batch culture of growing cells for production of
xanthan gum.
Example 4.6 Xanthan gum production
Xanthan gum is produced using Xanthomonas campestris in batch culture. Laboratory experiments have shown that for each
gram of glucose utilised by the bacteria, 0.23 g oxygen and 0.01 g ammonia are consumed, while 0.75 g gum, 0.09 g cells, 0.27 g
gaseous CO 2 and 0.13 g H 2 0 are formed. Other components of the system such as phosphate can be neglected. Medium con-
taining glucose and ammonia dissolved in 20 000 litres water is pumped into a stirred fermenter and inoculated with X.
campestris. Mr is sparged into the fermenter; the total amount of off-gas recovered during the entire batch culture is 1250 kg.
Because of the high viscosity and difficulty in handling xanthan-gum solutions, the final gum concentration should not be
allowed to exceed 3.5 wt%.
(a) How much glucose and ammonia are required?

Calculate
(i) Calculation table.
Some preliminary calculations are required to start the mass-balance table. First, using 1 kg 1-1 as the density of water,
20 000 litres water is equivalent to 20 000 kg. Let A be the unknown mass of air added. At low pressure, air is composed of
21 mol% 0 2 and 79 mol% N2; we need to determine the composition ofair as mass fractions. In 100 gmol air:
02content=21gmol
I 32g

1 gm0i = 2212 g.

Ifthe total mass ofair in 100 gmol is (2212 + 672) = 2884 g, the composition ofair is:
672 g
• 100 = 23.3 mass% 0 2.
2884 g
2212 g
x 100 = 76.7 mass% N 2.

Therefore, the mass of 0 2 in the inlet air is 0.233A; the mass o f N 2 is 0.767A. Let Fdenote the total mass of feed medium
added; let P denote the total mass of product. We will perform the calculation to produce the maximum-allowable gum
concentration; therefore, the mass of gum in the product is 0.035P. With the assumption of 100% conversion of glucose
and N H 3, these compounds are not present in the product. Quantities known at the beginning of the problem are shown in

Finalise
(i) The specific questions.
From the completed mass-balance table, 978.3 kg glucose and 9.8 kg NH 3 are required. Calculation of percentage excess air is
based on oxygen as oxygen is the reacting component of air. Percentage excess can be calculated using Eq. (2.35) in units ofkg:
% excess air
=
kg 0 2 present - kg 0 2 required to react )
completely with the limiting substrate
• 100.
( kg O2 required to react completely }
with the limiting substrate
In this problem, both glucose and ammonia are limiting substrates. From stoichiometry and the mass-balance table, the
mass of oxygen required to react completely with 978.3 kg glucose and 9.8 kg N H 3 is:
978.3 kg
1 kg
(0.23 kg) = 225.0 kg 0 2.
The mass provided is 282.0 kg; therefore:
% excess air =
2 8 2 . 0 - 225.0
x 100 = 25.3%.
225.0
(ii) Answers.
(a) 980 kg glucose and 9.8 kg N H 3 are required.
(b) 25% excess air is provided.
4.5 Material Balances With Recycle, By-Pass
and Purge Streams
So far, we have performed mass balances on simple single-unit
processes. However, steady-state systems incorporating re-
cycle, by-pass and purge streams are common in bioprocess
industries; flow sheets illustrating these modes of operation are
shown in Figure 4.3. Material-balance calculations for such
systems can be somewhat more involved than those in
Examples 4.3 to 4.6; several balances are required before all
mass flows can be determined.
As an example, consider the system of Figure 4.4. Because
cells are the catalysts in fermentation processes, it is often
advantageous to recycle biomass from spent fermentation
broth. Cell recycle requires a separation device, such as a cen-
trifuge or gravity settling tank, to provide a concentrated
recycle stream under aseptic conditions. The flow sheet for cell
recycle is shown in Figure 4.5; as indicated, at least four4 Material Balances

different system boundaries can be defined. System I repre-
sents the overall recycle process; only the fresh feed and final
product streams cross this system boundary. In addition, separ-
ate material balances can be performed over each process unit:
the mixer, the fermenter and the settler. Other system bound-
aries could also be defined; for example, we could group the
mixer and fermenter, or settler and fermenter, together.
Material balances with recycle involve carrying out individual
mass-balance calculations for each designated system.
Depending on which quantities are known and what informa-
tion is sought, analysis of more than one system may be required
before the flow rates and compositions of all streams are known.
Mass balances with recycle, by-pass or purge usually
involve longer calculations than for simple processes, but are
not more difficult conceptually. Accordingly, we will not treat
these types of process further. Examples of mass-balance pro-
cedures for multi-unit processes can be found in standard
chemical-engineering texts, e.g. [ 1-3].4 Material Balances

4.6 Stoichiometry of Growth and Product
Formation
So far in this chapter, the law of conservation of mass has been
used to determine unknown quantities entering or leaving
bioprocesses. For mass balances with reaction such as
Examples 4.5 and 4.6, the stoichiometry of conversion must
be known before the mass balance can be solved. When cell
growth occurs, cells are a product of reaction and must be
represented in the reaction equation. In this section we will
discuss how reaction equations for growth and product syn-
thesis are formulated. Metabolic stoichiometry has many
applications in bioprocessing: as well as in mass and energy
balances, it can be used to compare theoretical and actual
product yields, check the consistency of experimental fermen-
tation data, and formulate nutrient medium.
4.6.1 Growth Stoichiometry
Balances
and Elemental
Despite its complexity and the thousands ofintracellular reac-
tions involved, cell growth obeys the law of conservation of
matter. All atoms of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and
other elements consumed during growth are incorporated into
new cells or excreted as products. Confining our attention to
those compounds taken up or produced in significant quan-
tity, if the only extracellular products formed are CO 2 and
H20, we can write the following equation for aerobic cell
growth:
CwH OyNz+ a 0 2 + b HOj Ni--9 cCHaO/3 N/~+ d CO 2 + e H 2 0 .
(4.4)
In Eq. (4.4), CwH x O,y N z is the chemical formula for the sub-
strate (e.g. for glucose w = 6, x = 12, y = 6 and z = 0), H Oh Ni
is the chemical formula for the nitrogen source, and CHa~O/3No
is the chemical 'formula' for dry biomass, a, b, c, d and e are
stoichiometric coefficients. Eq. (4.4) is written on the basis of
one mole ofsubstrate; therefore a moles 0 2 are consumed and
d moles CO 2 are formed per mole substrate reacted, etc. As
illustrated in Figure 4.6, the equation represents a macro-
scopic view of metabolism; it ignores the detailed structure of
the system and considers only those components which have
net interchange with the environment. Despite its simplicity,
the macroscopic approach provides a powerful tool for ther-
modynamic analysis. Eq. (4.4) does not include a multitude of
compounds such as ATP and NADH which are integral to
metabolism and undergo exchange cycles in cells, but are not
subject to net exchange with the environment. Compounds
such as vitamins and minerals taken up during metabolism
could be included; however, since these growth factors are
generally consumed in small quantity we assume here that
their contribution to the stoichiometry and energetics of4 Material Balances

reaction can be neglected. Other substrates and products can
easily be added if appropriate.
In Eq. (4.4), biomass is represented by the formula
CHaO/3N~. There is no fundamental objection to having a
molecular formula for Cells, even if it is not widely applied in
biology. The formula is a reflection of the biomass composi-
tion. As shown in Table 4.2, microorganisms such as
Escherichia coli contain a wide range of elements; however
90-950/0 of biomass can be accounted for by four major ele-
ments: C, H, O and N. Compositions of several species in
terms of these four elements are listed in Table 4.3. The for-
mulae in Table 4.3 refer to dry biomass and are based on one C
atom; the total amount ofbiomass formed during growth can
be accounted for by the stoichiometric coefficient c in Eq.
(4.4). Bacteria tend to have slightly higher nitrogen contents
(11-14%) than fungi (6.3-9.0%) [4]. For a particular species,
cel! composition depends also on culture conditions and sub-
strate utilised, hence the different entries in Table 4.3 for the
same organism. However, the results are remarkably similar
for different cells and conditions; CH1.800.5N0.2 can be used
as a general formula when composition analysis is not avail-
able. The average 'molecular weight' of biomass based on C,
H, O and N content is therefore 24.6, although 5-10% resid-
ual ash is often added to account for those elements not
included in the formula.
Eq. (4.4) is not complete unless the stoichiometric coeffi-
cients a, b, c, dand eare known. Once a formula for biomass is
obtained, these coefficients can be evaluated using normal pro-
cedures for balancing equations, i.e. elemental balances and
solution of simultaneous equations.

Notice that we have five unknown coefficients (a, b, c, dand e)
but only four balance equations. This means that additional
information is required before the equations can be solved.
Usually this information is obtained from experiments. A use-
ful measurable parameter is the respiratoryquotient(RQ):

When an experimental value of RQ is available, Eqs (4.5) to
(4.9) can be solved to determine the stoichiometric coeffi-
cients. The results, however, are sensitive to small errors in RQ,
which must be measured very accurately. When Eq. (4.4) is
completed, the quantities of substrate, nitrogen and oxygen
required for production ofbiomass can be determined directly.
Example 4.7 Stoichiometric coefficients for cell growth
Production of single-cell protein from hexadecane is described by the following reaction equation:
C16H34 + a O 2 + bNH 3 --> cCHl.6600.27N0.20 + d C O 2 + eH20
where CH 1.6600.27N0.20 represents the biomass. If RQ= 0.43, determine the stoichiometric coefficients.
Solution:
C balance:
16 = c + d

H balance:3 4 + 3 b= 1.66 c + 2 e
O balance:2 a=0.27 c + 2 d + e
N balance:b = 0.20 c

We must solve this set of simultaneous equations. Solution can be achieved in many different ways; usually it is a good idea to
express each variable as a function of only one other variable, b is already written simply as a function of cin (4); let us try express-
ing the other variables solely in terms of c. From (1):
d- 16-c.
(6)
From (5):
a -
d
0.43
- 2.326 d.
(7)
Combining (6) and (7) gives an expression for a in terms of c only:
a = 2.326 ( 1 6 - c)
a - 3 7 . 2 2 - 2.326 c.
(8)
Substituting (4) into (2) gives:
34 + 3 (0.20 c) - 1.66 c+ 2 e
34 = 1.06 c+ 2 e
e = 1 7 - 0 . 5 3 c.
(9)
Substituting (8), (6) and (9) into (3) gives:
2 ( 3 7 . 2 2 - 2 . 3 2 6 c) = 0.27 c+ 2 ( 1 6 - c) + ( 1 7 - 0.53 c)
25.44 - 2.39 c
c - 10.64.
Using this result for cin (8), (4), (6) and (9) gives:
a - 12.48
b-2.13
d - 5.37
e - 11.36.
Check that these coefficient values satisfy Eqs (1)-(5).
The complete reaction equation is:
C16H34 + 12.5 0 2 + 2.13 N H 3 --> 10.6 CH1.6600.27N0.20 + 5.37 C O 2 + 11.4 H 2 0 .
Although elemental balances are useful, the presence of water
in Eq. (4.4) causes some problems in practical application.
Because water is usually present in great excess and changes in
water concentration are inconvenient to measure or
experimentally verify, H and O balances can present difficult-
ies. Instead, a useful principle is conservation of reducing
power or available electrons, which can be applied to deter-
mine quantitative relationships between substrates and4 Material Balances
78
products. An electron balance shows how available electrons
from the substrate are distributed in reaction.
4.6.2
Electron Balances
Available electrons refers to the number of electrons available
for transfer to oxygen on combustion of a substance to CO 2,
H 2 0 and nitrogen-containing compounds. The number of
available electrons found in organic material is calculated from
the valence of the various elements: 4 for C, 1 for H , - 2 for O,
5 for P, and 6 for S. The number of available electrons for N
depends on the reference state:-3 if ammonia is the reference,
0 for molecular nitrogen N 2, and 5 for nitrate. The reference
state for cell growth is usually chosen to be the same as the
nitrogen source in the medium. In the following discussion it
will be assumed for convenience that ammonia is used as nitro-
gen source; this can easily be changed if other nitrogen sources
are employed [5].
Degree o f reduction, )', is defined as the number of equiva-
lents of available electrons in that quantity of material
containing 1 g atom carbon. Therefore, for substrate
CwHxOyN z, the number of available electrons is (4w + x - 2y
- 3z). The degree of reduction for the substrate, Ys, is therefore
(4w + x - 2y - 3z)/w. Degrees of reduction relative to NH 3
and N 2 for several biological compounds are given in Table
B.2 in Appendix B. Degree of reduction for CO 2, H 2 0 and
NH 3 is zero.
Electrons available for transfer to oxygen are conserved during
metabolism. In a balanced growth equation, number of avail-
able electrons is conserved by virtue of the fact that the
amounts of each chemical element are conserved. Applying
this principle to Eq. (4.4) with ammonia as nitrogen source,
the available-electron balance is:
wys - 4a = cyB
(4.10)
where Ys and YB are the degrees of reduction of substrate and
biomass, respectively. Note that the available-electron balance
is not independent of the complete set of elemental balances; if
the stoichiometric equation is balanced in terms of each ele-
ment including H and O, the electron balance is implicitly
satisfied.
4.6.3
Biomass Yield
Typically, Eq. (4.10) is used with carbon and nitrogen balances
Eqs (4.5) and (4.8) and a measured value of RQfor evaluation
of stoichiometric coefficients. However, one electron balance,
two elemental balances and one measured quantity are still
inadequate information for solution of five unknown coeffi-
cients; another experimental quantity is required. As cells grow
there is, as a general approximation, a linear relationship
between the amount of biomass produced and the amount of
substrate consumed. This relationship is expressed quantita-
tively using the biomassyield, Yxs:
YXS =
g cells produced
g substrate consumed "
(4.11)
A large number of factors influences biomass yield, including
medium composition, nature of the carbon and nitrogen
sources, pH and temperature. Biomass yield is greater in aero-
bic than in anaerobic cultures; choice of electron acceptor, e.g.
02, nitrate or sulphate, can also have a significant effect [5, 6].
When Yxs is constant throughout growth, its experimen-
tally-determined value can be used to determine the
stoichiometric coefficient c in Eq. (4.4). Eq. (4.11) expressed
in terms of the stoichiometric Eq. (4.4) is:
c (MW cells)
Yxs = (MW substrate)
(4.12)
where MW is molecular weight and 'MW cells' means the
biomass formula-weight plus any residual ash. However,
before applying measured values of Yxs and Eq. (4.12) to
evaluate c, we must be sure that the experimental culture sys-
tem is well represented by the stoichiometric equation. For
example, we must be sure that substrate is not used to synthe-
sise extracellular products other than CO 2 and H20. One
complication with real cultures is that some fraction of sub-
strate consumed is always used for maintenance activities such
as maintenance of membrane potential and internal pH,
turnover of cellular components and cell motility. These
metabolic functions require substrate but do not necessarily
produce cell biomass, CO 2 and H 2 0 in the way described by
Eq. (4.4). It is important to account for maintenance when
experimental information is used to complete stoichiometric
equations; maintenance requirements and the difference
between observed and true yields are discussed further in
Chapter 11. For the time being, we will assume that available
values for biomass yield reflect substrate consumption for
growth only.4 Material Balances

4.6.4 Product Stoichiometry
Consider formation of an extracellular product C;HkOIN m
during growth. Eq. (4.4) can be extended to includJe product
synthesis as follows:
CwHxO Nz+ a O 2 + b H OhN.
---> c CHroeO/3N,s+ d C O 2 ~ - e H ' 2 0 + f C j H k O l N m
(4.13)
where f i s the stoichiometric coefficient for product. Product
synthesis introduces one extra unknown stoichiometric coeffi-
cient to the equation; thus, an additional relationship between
coefficients is required. This is usually provided as another
experimentally-determined yield coefficient, the product yield
from substrate, YPS:
g product formed
YPs =
g substrate consumed
Eq. (4.16) is a very useful equation. It means that if we know
which organism (YB)' substrate (wand Ys) and product (j and
YI,) are involved in cell culture, and the yields of biomass (c)
and product (f), we can quickly calculate the oxygen demand.
Of course we could also determine a by solving for all the stoi-
chiometric coefficients of Eq. (4.13) as described in Section
4.6.1. Eq. (4.16) allows more rapid evaluation and does not
require that the quantities of N H 3, CO 2 and H 2 0 involved in
the reaction be known.
4.6.6 Maximum Possible Yield
From Eq. (4.15) the fractional allocation of available electrons
in the substrate can be written as:
4a + cyB + fjyp
W?'s Wls
W~'s
f ( M W product)
(MW substrate)
(4.17)
(4.14)
As mentioned above with regard to biomass yields, we must be
sure that the experimental system used to measure YPS con-
forms to Eq. (4.13). Eq. (4.13) does not hold if product
formation is not directly linked with growth; accordingly it
cannot be applied for secondary-metabolite production such
as penicillin fermentation, or for biotransformations such as
steroid hydroxylation which involve only a small number of
enzymes in cells. In these cases, independent reaction equa-
tions must be used to describe growth and product synthesis.
In Eq. (4.17), the first term on the right-hand side is the frac-
tion of available electrons transferred from substrate to
oxygen, the second term is the fraction of available electrons
transferred to biomass, and the third term is the fraction of
available electrons transferred to product. This relationship
can be used to obtain upper bounds for the yields of biomass
and product from substrate.
Let us define CB as the fraction of available electrons in the
substrate transferred to biomass:
~'B -- c'YB
w)' s
4.6.5 Theoretical Oxygen Demand
Oxygen demand is an important parameter in bioprocessing as
oxygen is often the limiting substrate in aerobic fermentations.
Oxygen demand is represented by the stoichiometric coeffi-
cient a in Eqs (4.4) and (4.13). Oxygen requirement is related
directly to the electrons available for transfer to oxygen; the
oxygen demand can therefore be derived from an appropriate
electron balance. When product synthesis occurs as repre-
sented by Eq. (4.13), the electron balance is:
(4.18)
In the absence of product formation, if all available electrons
were used for biomass synthesis, ~'B would equal unity. Under
these conditions, the maximum value of the stoichiometric
coefficient c is:
_ W)'s
Cmax --
wys - 4a = cyB + f j yp
(4.15)
where yp is the degree of reduction of the product.
Rearranging gives:
a = 1/4 (W)'s - C~r - f j
Yp).
(4.16)
(4.19)
Cmax can be converted to a biomass yield with mass units using
Eq. (4.12). Therefore, even if we do not know the stoichiom-
etry of growth, we can quickly calculate an upper limit for
biomass yield from the molecular formulae for substrate and
product. If the composition of the cells is unknown, YBcan be4 Material Balances

CHI.800.5N0.2. Maximum biomass yields for several sub-
strates are listed in Table 4.4; maximum biomass yield can be
expressed in terms of mass ( Yxs,max)'or as number of C atoms
in the biomass per substrate C atom consumed (Cmax/w).These
quantities are sometimes known as thermodynamic maximum
biomass yields. Table 4.4 shows that substrates with high
energy content, indicated by high Ys values, give high maxi-
mum biomass yields.

Example 4.8 Productyield and oxygen demand
The chemical reaction equation for respiration of glucose is:
C6H1206 + 6 02 --~ 6 CO 2 + 6 H20.4 Material Balances
81
Candida utilis cells convert glucose to C O 2 and H 2 0 during growth. The cell composition is CH1.8400.55N0.2 plus 5% ash.
Yield ofbiomass from substrate is 0.5 g g- 1. Ammonia is used as nitrogen source.
(a) What is the oxygen demand with growth compared to that without?
(b) C. utilisis also able to grow with ethanol as substrate, producing cells of the same composition as above. On a mass basis, how
does the maximum possible biomass yield from ethanol compare with the maximum possible yield from glucose?
Solution:
Molecular weights:
glucose = 180
ethanol = 46
M W biomass is (25.44 + ash); since ash accounts for 5% of the total weight, 95% of the total = 25.44. Therefore, M W biomass
- 25-44/0.95 - 26.78. From Table B.2, Ys for glucose is 4.00; Ys for ethanol is 6.00.78 - (4 • 1 + 1 x 1.84 - 2 x 0.55 - 3 x 0.2)
- 4.14. For glucose w = 6; for ethanol w = 2.
(a) Yxs = 0.5 g g- 1. Converting this mass yield to a molar yield:
gxs -"
180 g glucose
1 gmol biomass
0.5 g biomass
g glucose
" 1 gmol glucose " 26.78 g biomass
gmol biomass
Yxs = 3.36 gmol glucose = c.
Oxygen demand is given by Eq. (4.16). In the absence of product formation:
a = 1/4 [6 (4.00)- 3.36 (4.14)] = 2.52.
Therefore, the oxygen demand for glucose respiration with growth is 2.5 gmol 0 2 per gmol glucose consumed. By comparison
with the chemical reaction equation for respiration, this is only about 42% that required in the absence of growth.
(b) Maximum possible biomass yield is given by Eq. (4.19). Using the data above, for glucose:
Cmax --
6(4.00)
= 5.80.

Converting this to a mass basis:

Therefore, on a mass basis, the maximum possible amount of biomass produced per gram ethanol consumed is roughly twice
that per gram glucose consumed. This result is consistent with the data listed in Table 4.4.
Example 4.8 illustrates two important points. First, the chem-
ical reaction equation for conversion of substrate without
growth is a poor approximation of overall stoichiometry when
cell growth occurs. When estimating yields and oxygen
requirements for any process involving cell growth, the full
stoichiometric equation including biomass should be used.
Second, the chemical nature or oxidation state of the substrate
has a major influence on product and biomass yield through
the number of available electrons.

Problems
4.1
Cell concentration
using membranes
A battery of cylindrical hollow-fibre membranes is operated at
steady state to concentrate a bacterial suspension from a fer-
menter. 350 kg min-1 fermenter broth is pumped through a
stack of hollow-fibre membranes as shown in Figure 4P1.1.
The broth contains 1% bacteria; the rest may be considered
water. Buffer solution enters the annular space around the
membrane tubes at a flow rate of 80 kg min-1; because broth
in the membrane tubes is under pressure, water is forced across
The aim of the membrane system is to produce a cell suspen-
sion containing 6% biomass.
(a) What is the flow rate from the annular space?
(b) What is the flow rate of cell suspension from the mem-
brane tubes?
Assume that the cells are not active, i.e. they do not grow.
Assume further that the membrane does not allow any mol-
ecules other than water to pass from annulus to inner cylinder,
or vice versa.
4.2
Membrane
reactor
A battery of cylindrical membranes similar to that shown in
Figure 4Pl.1 is used for an extractive bioconversion.
Extractive bioconversion means that fermentation and extrac-
tion of product occur at the same time.
Yeast cells are immobilised within the membrane walls. A
10% glucose in water solution is passed through the annular
space at a rate of 40 kg h - 1. An organic solvent, such as 2-ethyl-
1,3-hexanediol, enters the inner tube at a rate of 40 kg h-1.4 Material. Balances
83
Because the membrane is constructed of a polymer which
repels organic solvents, the hexanediol cannot penetrate the
membrane and the yeast is relatively unaffected by its toxicity.
On the other hand, because glucose and water are virtually
insoluble in 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, these compounds do not
enter the inner tube to an appreciable extent. Once immobil-
ised in the membrane, the yeast cannot reproduce but convert
glucose to ethanol according to the equation:
dehydrated egg product leaving the enzyme reactor is 0.2%.

Ethanol is soluble in 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol; it diffuses into
the inner tube and is carried out of the system. CO 2 gas exits
from the membrane unit through an escape valve. In the aque-

unconverted glucose is 0.2% and the concentration of ethanol
is 0.5%. If the system operates at steady state:

Energy Balances
Unlike many chemical processes, bioprocesses are not particularly energy intensive. Fermenters and enzyme reactors are oper-
ated at temperatures and pressures close to ambient; energy input for downstream processing is minimised to avoid damaging
heat-labile products. Nevertheless, energy effects are important because biological catalysts are very sensitive to heat and
changes in temperature. In large-scale processes, heat released during reaction can cause cell death or denaturation of enzymes
i f it is not quickly removed. For rational design of temperature-control facilities, energy flows in the system must be deter-
mined using energy balances. Energy effects are also important in other areas of bioprocessing such as steam sterilisation.
The law of conservation of energy means that an energy
accounting system can be set up to determine the amount of
steam or cooling water required to maintain optimum process
temperatures. In this chapter, after the necessary thermo-
dynamic concepts are explained, an energy-conservation equa-
tion applicable to biological processes is derived. The
calculation techniques outlined in Chapter 4 are then
extended for solution of simple energy-balance problems.
5.1 Basic Energy Concepts
the system. In a flow-through process, fluid at the inlet has
work done on it by fluid just outside of the system, while fluid
at the outlet does work on the fluid in front to push the flow
along. Flow work is given by the expression:
=pv
(5.1)
where p is pressure and Vis volume. (Convince yourself that
p Vhas the same dimensions as work and energy.)
Energy takes three forms:
5.1.1
(i) kinetic energy, Ek;
(ii) potential energy, Ep; and
(iii) internal energy, U.
Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a moving system
because of its velocity. Potential energyis due to the position of
the system in a gravitational or electromagnetic field, or due to
the conformation of the system relative to an equilibrium posi-
tion (e.g. compression of a spring). Internal energy is the sum of
all molecular, atomic and sub-atomic energies of matter.
Internal energy cannot be measured directly or known in abso-
lute terms; we can only quantify change in internal energy.
Energy is transferred as either heat or work. Heat is energy
which flows across system boundaries because of a tempera-
ture difference between the system and surroundings. Work is
energy transferred as a result of any driving force other than
temperature difference. There are two types of work: shaft
work Ws, which is work done by a moving part within the
system, e.g., an impeller mixing a fermentation broth, andflow
work Wf. Flow work is the energy required to push matter into
Units
The SI unit for energy is the joule (J): 1 J = 1 newton metre
(N m). Another unit is the calorie (cal), which is defined as the
heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g pure water by 1~
at 1 atm pressure. The quantity of heat according to this defi-
nition depends somewhat on the temperature of the water;
because there has been no universal agreement on a reference
temperature, there are several slightly different calorie-units in
use. The international table calorie (caliT) is fixed at 4.1868 J
exactly. In imperial units, the British thermal unit (Btu) is
common; this is defined as the amount of energy required to
raise the temperature of 1 lb water by I~ at 1 atm pressure. As
with the calorie, a reference temperature is required for this
definition; 60~ is common although other temperatures are
sometimes used.
5.1.2
Intensive and Extensive Properties
Properties of matter fall into two categories: those whose mag-
nitude depends on the quantity of matter present and those5 Energy Balances
87
whose magnitude does not. Temperature, density, and mole
fraction are examples of properties which are independent of
the size of the system; these quantities are called intensive vari-
ables. On the other hand, mass, volume and energy are
extensive variables which change if mass is added to or removed
from the system. Extensive variables can be converted to
specific quantities by dividing by the mass of the system; for
example, specific volume is volume divided by mass. Because
specific properties are independent of the mass of the system,
they are also intensive variables. In this chapter, for extensive
properties denoted by an upper-case symbol, the specific prop-
erty is given in lower-case notation. Therefore if Uis internal
energy, u denotes specific internal energy with units, e.g.
kJ g-1. Although, strictly speaking, the term 'specific' refers to
the quantity per unit mass, we will use the same lower-case
symbols for molar quantities, e.g. with units kJ gmo1-1.
5.1.3 Enthalpy
Enthalpy is a property used frequently in energy-balance calcu-
lations. It is defined as the combination of two energy terms:
H= U + p V
(5.2)
where His enthalpy, U is internal energy, p is pressure and Vis
volume. Specific enthalpy h is therefore:
Figure 5.1
Flow system for energy-balance calculations.
Mi
Mo
0
For practical application of this equation, consider the
system depicted in Figure 5.1. Mass M i enters the system while
mass M o leaves. Both these masses have energy associated with
them in the form of internal, kinetic and potential energy; flow
work is also being done. Energy leaves the system as heat Q;
shaft work Ws is done on the system by the surroundings. We
will assume that the system is homogeneous without charge or
surface-energy effects.
To apply Eq. (5.4), we must identify which forms ofenergy
are involved in each term of the expression. If we group togeth-
er the extensive properties and express them as specific
variables multiplied by mass, Eq. (5.4) can be written:
Mi (U+ ek+ ep+pV)i-Mo (U+ ek+ ep+pV)o- Q+ Ws=AE
(5.5)
h= u+pv
(5.3)
where u is specific internal-energy and v is specific volume.
Since internal energy cannot be measured or known in absol-
ute terms, neither can enthalpy."
5.2 General Energy-Balance Equations
The principle underlying all energy-balance calculations is the
law of conservation of energy, which states that energy can be
neither created nor destroyed. Although this law does not apply
to nuclear reactions, conservation of energy remains a valid
principle for bioprocesses because nuclear rearrangements are
not involved. In the following sections, we will derive the equa-
tions used for solution of energy-balance problems.
The law of conservation of energy can be written as:
energy in through
system boundaries
I energyout through

(5.4)
where subscripts i and o refer to inlet and outlet conditions,
respectively, and AE represents the total change or accumula-
tion of energy in the system, u is specific internal energy, ek is
specific kinetic energy, ep is specific

pressure, and v is specific volume. All energies associated with
masses crossing the system boundary are added together; the
energy-transfer terms Q and W are considered separately.
Shaft work appears explicitly in Eq. (5.5) as Wss;flow work
done the by inlet and outlet streams is represented as pv multi-
plied by mass.
Energy flows represented by Q and W can be directed
either into or out of the system; appropriate signs must be used
to indicate the direction of flow. Because it is usual in bio-
processes that shaft work be done on the system by external
sources, in this text we will adopt the convention that work is
positive when energy flows from the surroundings to the
system as shown in Figure 5.1. Conversely, work will be con-
sidered negative when the system supplies work energy to the
surroundings. On the other hand, we will regard heat as posi-
tive when the surroundings receives energy from the system,5 EnergyBalances
88
i.e. when the temperature of the system is higher than the sur-
roundings. Therefore, when Ws and Q are positive quantities,
Ws makes a positive contribution to the energy content of the
system while Q causes a reduction. These effects are accounted
for in Eq. (5.5) by the signs preceding Qand Ws. The opposite
sign convention is sometimes used in thermodynamics texts.
Choice of sign convention is arbitrary if used consistently.
Eq. (5.5) refers to a process with only one input and one
output stream. A more general equation is Eq. (5.6), which
can be used for any number of separate material flows:
E M ( u + ek + ep+pV ) - Y M ( U + ek + ep+pV )
input
streams
output
streams
- Q + Ws=AE.
(5.6)
The symbol E means summation; the internal, kinetic,
potential and flow work energies associated with all output
streams are added together and subtracted from the sum for all
input streams. Eq. (5.6) is a basic form of the first law o f ther-
modynamics, a simple mathematical expression of the law of
conservation ofenergy. The equation can be shortened by sub-
stituting enthalpy h for u + pv as defined by Eq. (5.3):
Y~ M ( h + ek + ep) - ,Y_,M ( h + ek + ep) - Q + Ws= AE.

5.2.1 Special Cases
Eq. (5.7) can be simplified considerably if the following
assumptions are made:
These assumptions are acceptable for bioprocesses, in which
high-velocity motion and large changes in height or electro-
magnetic field do not generally occur. Thus, the
energy-balance equation becomes:
E (Mh) - Y. (Mh) - Q + w s = AE.

(5.9)
Eq. (5.9) can also be applied over the entire duration of
batch and fed-batch processes if there is no energy accumu-
lation; 'output streams' in this case refers to the harvesting
of all mass in the system at the end of the process. Eq. (5.9)
is used frequently in bioprocess energy balances.
(ii) Adiabaticprocess. A process in which no heat is transferred
to or from the system is termed adiabatic; if the system
has an adiabatic wall it cannot receive or release heat to
the surroundings. Under these conditions Q - 0 and Eq.
(5.8) becomes:
~, (Mh) - ~, (Mh) + W = AE.

(5.10)
Eqs (5.8)-(5.10) are energy-balance equations which allow us
to predict, for example, how much heat must be removed
from a fermenter to maintain optimum conditions, or the
effect of evaporation on cooling requirements. To apply the
equations we must know the specific enthalpy h of flow
streams entering or leaving the system. Methods for calculat-
ing enthalpy are outlined in the following sections.
5.3 Enthalpy Calculation Procedures
Irrespective of how enthalpy changes occur, certain conven-
tions are used in enthalpy calculations.
(i) kinetic energy is negligible; and
(ii) potential energy is negligible.
input
The steady-state energy-balance equation is:
Steady-stateflow process. At steady state, all properties of
the system are invariant. Therefore, there can be no accu-
mulation or change in the energy of the system: AE = 0.
5.3.1 Reference States
Specific enthalpy h appears explicitly in energy-balance equa-
tions. What values of h do we use in these equations ifenthalpy
cannot be measured or known in absolute terms? Because
energy balances are actually concerned with the difference in
enthalpy between incoming and outgoing streams, we can
overcome any difficulties by working always in terms of
enthalpy change. In many energy-balance problems, changes
in enthalpy are evaluated relative to reference states that must
be defined at the beginning of the calculation.
Because Hcannot be known absolutely, it is convenient to
assign H = 0 to some reference state. For example, when
1 gmol carbon dioxide is heated at 1 atm pressure from 0~ to
25~ the change in enthalpy of the gas can be calculated5 Energy Balances
89
(using methods explained later) as A H = 0.91 kJ. If we assign
H - 0 for CO 2 gas at 0~ H a t 25~ can be considered to be
0.91 kJ. This result does not mean that the absolute value of
enthalpy at 25~ is 0.91 kJ; we can say only that the enthalpy
at 25~ is 0.91 kJ relative to the enthalpy at 0~
We will use various reference states in energy-balance cal-
culations to determine enthalpy change. Suppose for example
we want to calculate the change in enthalpy as a system moves
from State 1 to State 2. If the enthalpies of States 1 and 2 are
known relative to the same reference condition/-/re f, AHis cal-
culated as follows:

5.3.25.4 Enthalpy Change in Non-Reactive
Processes
State Properties
Values of some variables depend only on the state of the system
and not on how that state was reached. These variables are
called state properties or functions of state; examples include
temperature, pressure, density and composition. On the other
hand, work is a path function since the amount of work done
depends on the way in which the final state of the system is
obtained from previous states.
Enthalpy is a statefunction. This property ofenthalpy is very
handy in energy-balance calculations; it means that change in
enthalpy for a process can be calculated by taking a series of
hypothetical steps or processpath leading from the initial state
and eventually reaching the final state. Change in enthalpy is
calculated for each step; the total enthalpy change for the pro-
cess is then equal to the sum of changes in the hypothetical
path. This is true even though the process path used for calcu-
lation is not the same as that actually undergone by the system.
As an example, consider the enthalpy change for the process
shown in Figure 5.2 in which hydrogen peroxide is converted
to oxygen and water by catalase enzyme. The enthalpy change
for the direct process at 35~ can be calculated using an alter-
native pathway in which hydrogen peroxide is first cooled to
25~ oxygen and water are formed by reaction at 25~ and
the products then heated to 35~ Because the initial and final
states for both actual and hypothetical paths are the same, the
total enthalpy change is also identical:
AH = AH 1+ AH 2 + AH 3
(5.11)
Change in enthalpy can occur as a result of:
(i) temperature change;
(ii) change ofphase;
(iii) mixing or solution; and
(iv) reaction.
In the remainder of this section we will consider enthalpy
changes associated with (i), (ii) and (iii). We will then consider
how the results are used in energy-balance calculations. Pro-
cesses involving reaction will be discussed in Sections 5.8-5.11.
5.4.1
Change in Temperature
Heat transferred to raise or lower the temperature of a material
is called sensible heat; change in the enthalpy of a system due to
variation in temperature is called sensible heat change. In
energy-balance calculations, sensible heat change is deter-
mined using a property of matter called the heat capacity at
constant pressure, or just heat capacity. We will use the symbol
Cp for heat capacity; units for Cp are, e.g. J gmo1-1 K -1,
cal g-1 oC - 1 and Btu lb-1 o F - 1. The term specific heat refers
to heat capacity expressed on a per-unit-mass basis. Heat
capacity must be known before enthalpy changes from heating
or cooling can be determined. Tables B.3-B.6 in Appendix B
list Cp values for several organic and inorganic compounds.
Additional Cp data and information about estimating heat
capacities can be found in references such as Chemical5 Energy Balances
9~
Engineers' Handbook [ 1], Handbook of Chemistry and Physics
[2] and International Critical Tables [3].
There are several methods for calculating enthalpy change
using Cp values 9 When Cp is constant, the change in enthalpy of
a substance due to change in temperature at constant pressure is:
A H = MC A T= M @
where Mis either mass or moles of the substance depending on
the dimensions of Cp, T 1 is the initial temperature and T2 is
the final temperature. The corresponding change in specific
enthalpy is:
- TI)
(5.13)
(5.12)
Example 5.1 Sensible heat change with constant Cp
What is the enthalpy of 150 g formic acid at 70~ and 1 atm relative to 25~ and 1 atm?
Solution:
From Table B.5, Cp for formic acid in the temperature range ofinterest is 0.524 cal g - 1 oC - 1. Substituting into Eq (5.12)"
AH = (150 g) (0.524 cal g-~ ~
A H = 3537.0 cal
(70 - 25)~
or
A H = 3.54 kcal.
Relative to H = 0 at 25~
the enthalpy of formic acid at 70~ is 3.54 kcal.
Heat capacities for most substances vary with temperature.
This means that when we calculate enthalpy change due to
change in temperature, the value of C_p. itself varies over the
range ofA T. Heat capacities are often tabulated as polynomial
functions of temperature, such as:
Cp = a + b T+ c T 2 + d T 3.
(5.14)
Coefficients a, b, c and d for a number of substances are given
in Table B.3 in Appendix B.
Sometimes we can assume that heat capacity is constant;
this will give results for sensible heat change which approxi-
mate the true value. Because the temperature range of interest
in bioprocessing is relatively small, assuming constant heat
capacity for some materials does not introduce large errors. Cp
data may not be available at all temperatures; heat capacities
like most of those listed in Tables B.5 and B.6 are applicable
only at a specified temperature or temperature range. As an
example, in Table B.5 the heat capacity for liquid acetone
between 24.2~ and 49.4~ is given as 0.538 col g - i oc-1
even though this value will vary within the temperature range.
A useful rule of thumb for organic liquids near room
temperature is that Cp increases by 0.001-0.002 cal g - 1 o C - 1
for each Celsius-degree temperature increase [4].
One method for calculating sensible heat change when Cp
varies with temperature involves use of the mean heat capacity,
Cpm. Table B.4 in Appendix B lists mean heat capacities for
several common gases. These values are based on changes in
enthalpy relative to a single reference temperature, Tref= 0~
To determine the change in enthalpy for a change in tempera-
ture from T 1 to T2, read the values o f Cpm at T 1 and T2 and
calculate:
A H - M[(Cpm) T2 (T 2 - ~ref) -- (Cpm) 7~ ( T 1 - ~ref)].
(s.~s)
5.4.2 Change of Phase
Phase changes, such as vaporisation and melting, are accom-
panied by relatively large changes in internal energy and
enthalpy as bonds between molecules are broken and
reformed. Heat transferred to or from a system causing change
of phase at constant temperature and pressure is known as
latent heat. Types of latent heat are:
(i)
latent heat ofvaporisation (Ah). heat required to vaporise
a liquid;5 Energy Balances
91
(ii) latent heat offusion (Ahf): heat required to melt a solid;
and
(iii) latent heat of sublimation (Ahs): heat required to directly
vaporise a solid.
Condensation of gas to liquid requires removal rather than
addition of heat; the latent heat evolved in condensation is
- A h . Similarly, the latent heat evolved in freezing or solidifi-
cation of liquid to solid is -Ahf.
Latent heat is a property of substances and, like heat capacity,
varies with temperature. Tabulated values of latent heats usu-
ally apply to substances at their normal boiling, melting or
sublimation point at 1 atm, and are called standard heats ofphase
change. Table B.7 in Appendix B lists latent heats for selected
compounds; more values may be found in Chemical Engineers"
Handbook [1] and Handbook of Chemistry and Physics [2].
The change in enthalpy resulting from phase change is cal-
culated directly from the latent heat. For example, increase in
enthalpy due to evaporation of liquid mass M a t constant tem-
perature is:
AH = MAh.
(5.16)
Example 5.2 Enthalpy of condensation
50 g benzaldehyde vapour is condensed at 179~
What is the enthalpy of the liquid relative to the vapour?
Solution:
From Table B.7, the molecular weight ofbenzaldehyde is 106.12, the normal boiling point is 179.0~ and the standard heat of
vaporisation is 38.40 kJ gmol- 1. For condensation the latent heat is - 38.40 kJ gmol- 1. The enthalpy change is:
AH = 50 g ( - 38.40 kJ gmol- 1).
lgmol
106.12 g
= - 18.09 kJ.
Therefore, the enthalpy of 50 g benzaldehyde liquid relative to the vapour at 179~ is - 18.09 kJ. As heat is released during
condensation, the enthalpy of the liquid is lower than the vapour.
Phase changes often occur at temperatures other than the nor-
mal boiling, melting or sublimation point; for example, water
can evaporate at temperatures higher or lower than 100~
How can we determine AHwhen the latent heat at the actual
temperature of the phase change is not listed in the tables? This
problem is overcome by using a hypothetical process path as
described in Section 5.3.2. Suppose a substance is vaporised
isothermally at 30~ although tabulated values for standard
heat ofvaporisation refer to 60~ As shown in Figure 5.3, we
can consider a process whereby liquid is heated from 30~ to
60~ vaporised at 60~ and the vapour cooled to 30~ The
total enthalpy change for this process is the same as ifvaporisa-
tion occurred directly at 30~ AH 1 and AH 3 are sensible heat
changes and can be calculated using heat-capacity values and
the methods described in Section 5.4.1. AH 2 is the latent heat
at standard conditions available from tables. Because enthalpy
is a state property, AHfor the actual path is the same as AH i +
compounds, the thermodynamic properties of the mixture are
a simple sum of contributions from the individual components.
However, when compounds are mixed or dissolved, bonds
between molecules in the solvent and solute are broken and
reformed. In realsolutions a net absorption or release of energy
accompanies these processes resulting in changes in the
internal energy and enthalpy of the mixture. Dilution of sub
phuric acid with water is a good example; in this case energy is

released. For real solutions there is an additional energy term
to consider in evaluating enthalpy: the integral heat of mixing
or integral heat ofsolution, Ab m. The integral heat of solution is
defined as the change in enthalpy which occurs as one mole of
solute is dissolved at constant temperature in a given quantity
of solvent. The enthalpy of a non-ideal mixture of two com-
pounds A and B is:
/-/mixture= HA + HB + AHm
(5.17)
where AH m is the heat of mixing.
Heat of mixing is a property of the solution components
and is dependent on the temperature and concentration of
the mixture. As a solution becomes more and more dilute,
an asymptotic value of Ahm is reached. This value is called
the integral heat of solution at infinite dilution. When water
is the primary component of solutions, Ahm at infinite dilu-
tion can be used to calculate the enthalpy of the mixture.
Ah m values for seiected aqueous solutions are listed in
Chemical Engineers' Handbook [1 ], Handbook of Chemistry
and Physics [2] and Biochemical Engineering and
Biotechnology Handbook [5].
Example 5.3 Heat of solution
Malonic acid and water are initially at 25~ If 15 g malonic acid is dissolved in 5 kg water, how much heat must be added for the
solution to remain at 25~ What is the solution enthalpy relative to the components?
Solution:
The molecular weight of malonic acid is 104. Because the solution is very dilute (< 0.3% w/w), we can use the integral heat of
solution at infinite dilution. From handbooks, Ahm at room temperature is 4.493 kcal gmo1-1. This value is positive; therefore
the mixture enthalpy is greater than the components and heat is absorbed during solution. The heat required for the solution to
remain at 25~ is:
AH= 4.493 kcal gmol-1 (15 g) .
1 gmol
104 g
= 0.648 kcal.
Relative to H = 0 for water and malonic acid at 25~
the enthalpy of the solution at 25~ is 0.648 kcal.
In biological systems, significant changes in enthalpy due to
heats of mixing do not often occur. Most solutions in fermen-
tation and enzyme processes are dilute aqueous mixtures; in
energy-balance calculations these solutions are usually con-
sidered ideal without much loss of accuracy.
5.5 S t e a m Tables
Steam tables have been used for many years by engineers
designing industrial processes and power stations. These tables
list the thermodynamic properties of water, including specific
volume, internal energy and enthalpy. As we are mainly con-
cerned here with enthalpies, a list of enthalpy values for steam
and water under various conditions has been extracted from
the steam tables and given in Appendix C [6]. All enthalpy
values must have a reference point; in the steam tables of
Appendix C, H = 0 for liquid water at the triple point: 0.01 ~
and 0.6112 kPa pressure. (The triple point is an invariant con-
dition of pressure and temperature at which ice, liquid water
and water vapour are in equilibrium with each other.) Steam
tables from other sources may have different reference states.
Steam tables eliminate the need for sensible-heat and latent-
heat calculations for water and steam, and can be used directly
in energy-balance calculations.
Tables C. 1 and C.2 in Appendix C list enthalpy values for
liquid water and saturated steam. When liquid and vapour are
in equilibrium with each other, they are saturated; a gas satu-
rated with water contains all the water it can hold at the
prevailing temperature and pressure. For a pure substance
such as water, once the temperature is specified, saturation
occurs at only one pressure. For example, from Table C.2 satu-
rated steam at 188~ has a pressure of 1200 kPa. Also from the
table, the enthalpy of this steam relative to the triple point of
water is 2782.7 kJ kg-1; liquid water in equilibrium with the
steam has an enthalpy of 798.4 kJ kg-1. The latent heat of
vaporisation under these conditions is the difference between
liquid and vapour enthalpies; as indicated in the middle
enthalpy column, A h is 1984.3 kJ kg -1. Table C.1 lists
enthalpies of saturated water and steam by temperature; Table
C.2 lists these enthalpies by pressure.93
5 Energy Balances
It is usual when using steam tables to ignore the effect of
pressure on the enthalpy of liquid water. For example, the
enthalpy of water at 40~ and 1 arm (101.3 kPa) is found by
looking up the enthalpy of saturated water at 40~ in Table
C. 1, and assuming the value is independent of pressure. This
assumption is valid at low pressure, i.e. less than about 50 arm.
The enthalpy of liquid water at 40~ and 1 atm is therefore
167.5 kJ kg -1.
Enthalpy values for superheated steam are given in Table
C.3. If the temperature of saturated vapour is increased (or the
pressure decreased at constant temperature), the vapour is said
to be superheated. A superheated vapour cannot condense
until it is returned to saturation conditions. The difference
between the temperature of a superheated gas and its satura-
tion temperature is called the degreesof superheat of the gas. In
Table C.3, enthalpy is listed as a function of temperature at 15
different pressures from 10 kPa to 50 000 kPa; for example,
superheated steam at 1000 kPa pressure and 250~ has an
enthalpy of 2943 kJ kg -1 relative to the triple point. Table
C.3 also lists properties at saturation conditions; at 1000 kPa
the saturation temperature is 179.9~ the enthalpy of liquid
water under these conditions is 762.6 kJ kg- 1, and the enthal-
py of saturated vapour is 2776.2 kJ kg-1. Thus, the degrees of
superheat for superheated steam at 1000 kPa and 250~ can
be calculated as (250 - 179.9) = 70.1 centigrade degrees.
Water under pressure remains liquid even at relatively high
temperatures. Enthalpy values for liquid water up to 350~
are found in the upper region of Table C.3 above the line
extending to the critical pressure.
5.6 Procedure For Energy-Balance
Calculations Without Reaction
Methods described in Section 5.4 for evaluating enthalpy can
be used to solve energy-balance problems for systems in which
reactions do not occur. Many of the points described in
Section 4.3 for material balances also apply when setting out
an energy balance.
(i)
A properly drawn and labelled flow diagram is essential to
identify all inlet and outlet streams and their composi-
tions. For energy balances, the temperatures, pressures
and phases of the material should also be indicated if
appropriate.
(ii) The units selected for the energy balance should be stated;
these units are also used when labelling the flow diagram.
(iii) As in mass balance problems, a basis for the calculation
must be chosen and stated clearly.
(iv) The referencestate for H= 0 is determined. In the absence
of reaction, reference states for each molecular species in
the system can be arbitrarily assigned.
(v) State all assumptions used in solution of the problem.
Assumptions such as absence of leaks and steady-state
operation for continuous processes are generally applic-
able.
Following on from (v), other assumptions commonly made
for energy balances include the following:
(a) The system is homogeneous or well mixed. Under these
conditions, product streams including gases leave the
system at the system temperature.
(b) Heats of mixing are often neglected for mixtures contain-
ing compounds of similar molecular structure. Gas
mixtures are always considered ideal.
(c) Sometimes shaft work can be neglected even though the
system is stirred by mechanical means. This assumption
may not apply when vigorous agitation is used or when
the liquid being stirred is very viscous. When shaft work
is not negligible you will need to know how much
mechanical energy is input through the stirrer.
(d) Evaporation in liquid systems may be considered neglig-
ible if the components are not particularly volatile or if
the operating temperature is relatively low.
(e) Heat losses from the system to the surroundings are often
ignored; this assumption is generally valid for large insu-
lated vessels when the operating temperature is close to
ambient.

The rate of heat loss to the surroundings is 7.0 • 104 kJ h - 1.
It is important to recognise that the final answers to energy-
balance problems do not depend on the choice of reference
states for the components. Although values of h depend on the
reference states, as discussed in Section 5.3.1 this dependence
disappears when the energy-balance equation is applied and
the difference between input and output enthalpies deter-
mined. To prove the point, any of the examples in this chapter
can be repeated using different reference conditions to obtain
the same final answers.
5.8 Enthalpy Change Due to Reaction
Reactions in bioprocesses occur as a result of enzyme activity
and cell metabolism. During reaction, relatively large changes
in internal energy and enthalpy occur as bonds between atoms
are rearranged. Heat of reaction AHrx n is the energy released or
absorbed during reaction, and is equal to the difference in
enthalpy of reactants and products:
AI'-I~R = ~ Mh -
~ Mh
products reactants
(5.18)
or
A nrx n = E n h -
~, nh
products reactants
(5.19)
where ]2 denotes the sum, M is mass, n is number of moles, and
h is specific enthalpy expressed on either a per-mass or per-
mole basis. Note that M and n represent the mass and moles
actually involved in the reaction, not the total amount present
in the system. In an exothermic reaction the energy required to
hold the atoms of product together is less than for the reac-
tants; surplus energy is released as heat and AHrxn is negative in
value. On the other hand, energy is absorbed during endother-
mic reaction~, the enthalpy of the products is greater than the
reactants and A/--/~n is positive.
The specific heat of reaction Ahrx n is a property of matter.
The value of Ahrxn depends on which reactants and products
are involved in the reaction and the temperature and pressure.
Because any molecule can participate in a large number of
reactions, it is not feasible to tabulate all possible Ahrx n values.
Instead, Ahrx n is calculated from the heats of combustion of
individual compounds.
5.8.1 Heat of Combustion
Heat of combustion Ahc is defined as the heat evolved during
reaction of a substance with oxygen to yield certain oxidation
products such as CO 2 gas, H 2 0 liquid and N 2 gas. The stan'
dard heat of combustion Ah ~ is the specific enthalpy change
associated with this reaction at standard conditions, usually
25~ and 1 atm pressure. By convention, Ah ~ is zero for the
products of oxidation, i.e. CO 2 gas, H 2 0 liquid, N 2 gas, etc.;
standard heats of combustion for other compounds are always
negative. Table B.8 in Appendix B lists selected values; heats of
combustion for other materials can be found in Chemical
Engineers" Handbook [1] and Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics [2]. As an example, the standard heat of combustion for
citric acid is given in Table B.8 as - 1 9 6 2 . 0 kJ gmol-l; this5 EnergyBalances

ible reactants and combustion products:
where n is moles of reactant or product involved in the reac-
tion, and Ah ~ is the standard heat of combustion per mole.
The standard heat of reaction is the difference between the
heats of combustion of reactants and products.

Conditions
Example 5.6 shows how to calculate the heat of reaction at
standard conditions. However, most reactions do not occur at
25~ and the standard heat of reaction calculated using Eq.
(5.20) may not be the same as the actual heat of reaction at the
reaction temperature.
Consider the following reaction between compounds A, B,
C and D occurring at temperature T:
a+b-+c+d.
The standard heat of reaction at 25~ is known from tabu-
lated heat of combustion data. AHrx n at temperature Tcan be
calculated using the alternative reaction pathway outlined in
Figure 5.4, in which reaction occurs at 25~ and the reactants
and products are heated or cooled between 25~ and Tbefore
and after the reaction. Because the initial and final states for
the actual and hypothetical paths are the same, the total
enthalpy change is also identical. Therefore:
A/q~n (at T) = AH 1+ AH~ + AH3
(5.21)
where AH 1 and AH3 are changes in sensible heat and AH~ is
the standard heat of reaction at 25~ AH 1 and AH3 are evalu-
ated using heat capacities and the methods described in
Section 5.4.1.

AH~ . For example, consider the reaction for respiration of
glucose:
C6H1206 + 6 0 2 --~ 6 CO 2 + 6 H20.
A H ~ n for this conversion is -2805.0 kJ; if the reaction occurs
at 37~ A/-/~n is -2801.7 kJ. Contributions from sensible
heat amount to only 3.3 kJ, which is insignificant compared
with the total magnitude of A H ~ and can be ignored without
much loss of accuracy. With reference to Figure 5.4, AH 1 -
- 4 . 8 kJ for cooling 1 gmol glucose and 6 gmol oxygen from
37~ to 25~ AH 3 = 8.1 kJ for heating the products back to
37~ Having opposite signs, AH 1 and AH 3 act to cancel each
other. This situation is typical of most reactions in bioprocess-
ing where the actual temperature of reaction is not sufficiently
different from 25~ to warrant concern about sensible heat
changes. When heat of reaction is substantial compared with
other types ofenthalpy change, A H n can be assumed equal to
AH~ irrespective of reaction temperature.
A major exception to this general rule are single-enzyme
conversions. Because most single-enzyme reactions involve
only small molecular rearrangements, heats of reaction are
relatively small. For instance, per mole of substrate, the fuma-
rase reaction of Example 5.6 involves a standard enthalpy
change of only 5.2 kJ; other examples are 8.7 kJ gmo1-1 for
the glucose isomerase reaction, - 26.2 kJ gmol- 1 for hydroly-
sis of sucrose, and - 2 9 . 4 kJ per gmol glucose for hydrolysis of
starch. For conversions such as these, sensible energy changes
of 5 to 10 kJ are clearly significant and should not be ignored.
Calculated enthalpy changes for enzyme reactions are often
imprecise; being the difference between two or more large num-
bers, the small AH~ for these conversions can carry
considerable uncertainty depending on the accuracy of the
heats of combustion data. When coupled with usual assump-
tions such as constant Cp and Ahm within the temperature
range of interest, this uncertainty means that estimates of heat-
ing and cooling requirements for enzyme reactors are
sometimes quite rough.
5.9 Heat of Reaction For Processes With
Biomass Production
Biochemical reactions in cells do not occur in isolation but are
linked in a complex array of metabolic transformations.
Catabolic and anabolic reactions take place at the same time,
so that energy released in one reaction is used in other energy-
requiring processes. Cells use chemical energy quite
efficiently; however some is inevitably released as heat. How
can we estimate the heat of reaction associated with cell
metabolism and growth?
5.9.1 Thermodynamics of Microbial Growth
As described in Section 4.6.1, a macroscopic view of cell
growth is represented by the equation:
CwHxOyNz+a O 2 + bHphNi--+ cCHaO3Na + dCO 2 + eH20
(4.4)
where a, b, c, d and e are stoichiometric coefficients,
CwHxOyNzis the substrate, HgOhN i is the nitrogen source,
and CHaO/3N a is dry biomass. Once the stoichiometric
coefficients or yields are determined, Eq. (4.4) can be used as
the reaction equation in energy-balance calculations. We
need, however, to determine the heat of reaction for this con-
version.
Heats of reaction for cell growth can be estimated using
microbial stoichiometry and the concept of available electrons
(Section 4.6.2). It has been found empirically that the energy
content of organic compounds is related to degree of reduc-
tion as follows:
zxao = - q r x
c
(5.22)
where Ahc~ is the molar heat of combustion at standard condi-
tions, q is the heat evolved per mole of available electrons
transferred to oxygen during combustion, y is the degree of
reduction of the compound defined with respect to N 2, and xC
is the number of carbon atoms in the molecular formula. The
coefficient q relating Ah ~ and y is relatively constant for a large
number of compounds. Patel and Erickson [7] assigned a
value of 111 kJ gmo1-1 to q; in another analysis, Roels [8]
determined a value of 115 kJ gmol-1. The correlation found5 Energy Balances
IOO
by Roels is based on analysis of several chemical and biochem-
ical compounds including biomass; the results are shown in
Figure 5.5.
5 . 9 . 2 H e a t o f R e a c t i o n W i t h O x y g e n as
Electron Acceptor
The direct proportionality between heat of combustion and
degree of reduction as shown in Figure 5.5 has important
implications for determining the heat of reaction in aerobic
culture. Degree of reduction is related directly to the amount
of oxygen required for complete combustion of a substance;
therefore, heat produced in reaction of compounds for which
Figure 5.5 applies must be directly proportional to oxygen
consumption. In aerobic cultures with oxygen the principal
acceptor of electrons, because molecular oxygen 0 2 accepts
four electrons, if one mole 0 2 is consumed during respiration,
four moles of electrons must be transferred. Accepting the
value of 115 kJ energy released per gmol electrons transferred,
the amount of energy released from consumption of one gmol
0 2 is therefore (4 x 115) kJ, or 460 kJ. This result, that the
heat of reaction for aerobic metabolism is approximately
- 4 6 0 kJ per gmol 0 2 consumed, is verified by the experimen-
tal data of Cooney, et al. [9] shown in Figure 3.2 (p. 33).
The value is quite accurate for a wide range of conditions,
including fermentations involving product formation. Thus,
once the amount of oxygen taken up during aerobic cell cul-
ture is known, the heat of reaction can be evaluated
immediately.
5.9.3 Heat of Reaction With Oxygen Not the
Principal Electron Acceptor
If a fermentation uses electron acceptors other than oxygen,
for example in anaerobic culture, the simple relationship for
heat of reaction derived in Section 5.9.2 does not apply. Heats
of combustion must be used to estimate the heat of reaction
for anaerobic conversions. Consider the following reaction
equation for anaerobic growth with product formation:
CwHxOyNz+ bHgOhNi--) cCHaO~Na + d C O 2 + eH20
+f CjH kOINm
(5.23)
where CjHkO/N m is an extracellular product and fis its stoi-
chiometric coefficient. With ammonia as nitrogen source and
heats of combustion of H20 and CO 2 zero, from Eq. (5.20)
the equation for standard heat of reaction is:

Actual heats of combustion measured by Cordier et al. [10] for
a range of microorganisms and culture conditions are listed in
Table 5.1. The difference in Ahc values for bacteria and yeast
reflects their different elemental compositions. When the
composition of a particular organism is unknown, the heat of
combustion for bacteria can be taken as - 2 3 . 2 kJ g-1; for
yeast Ahc is approximately - 2 1 . 2 kJ g-1. These experimen-
tally determined values compare well with that calculated in
Eq. (5.25). Once the heat of combustion of biomass is known,
it can be used with the heats of combustion for the other prod-
ucts and substrates to determine the heat of reaction.
5.10 Energy-Balance Equation For Cell
Culture
In fermentations, the heat of reaction so dominates the energy
balance that small enthalpy effects due to sensible heat change
and heats of mixing can generally be ignored. In this section
we incorporate these observations into a simplified energy-
balance equation for cell processes.
Table 5.1
Consider Eq. (5.9) applied to a continuous fermenter.
What are the major factors responsible for the enthalpy differ-
ence between input and output streams in fermentations?
Because cell-culture media are usually dilute aqueous solutions
with behaviour close to ideal, even though the composition of
the broth may change as substrates are consumed and products
formed, changes in heats of mixing of these solutes are gener-
ally negligible. Similarly, even though there may be a
temperature difference between input and output streams, the
overall change in enthalpy due to sensible heat is also small.
Usually, heat of reaction, latentheat of phase change and shaft
work are the only energy effects worth considering in fermen-
tation energy balances. Evaporation is the most likely phase
change in fermenter operation; if evaporation is controlled
then latent heat effects can also be ignored. Per cubic metre of
fermentation broth, metabolic reactions typically generate
5 - 2 0 kJ heat per second for growth on carbohydrate, and up
tO 60 kJ s-1 for growth on hydrocarbon substrates. By way
of comparison, in aerobic cultures sparged with dry air,
evaporation of the fermentation broth removes only about

IO:l,
0.5 kJ s-1 m-3 as latent heat. Energy input due to shaft work
varies between 0.5 and 5 kJ s-l m-3 in large-scale vessels and
10-20 kJ s- 1 m-3 in small vessels. Sensible heats and heats of
mixing are generally several orders of magnitude smaller.
For cell processes, therefore, we can simplify energy-
balance calculations by substituting expressions for heat of
reaction and latent heat for the first two terms of Eq. (5.9). By
the definition of Eq. (5.18), A/-/~n is the difference between
product and reactant enthalpies. As the products are contained
in the output flow and the reactants in the input, AHrxn is
approximately equal to the difference in enthalpy between
input and output streams. If evaporation is also significant, the
enthalpy ofvapour leaving the system will be greater than that
of liquid entering by M A h , where M is the mass of liquid
evaporated and A h is the latent heat of vaporisation. The
energy-balance equation can be modified as follows:
-A/-/n-
MAh
- Q+Ws=0.
(5.26)
A/-/~n has a negative sign in Eq. (5.26) because a/--/~n is equal
to [enthalpy of products - enthalpy of reactants] whereas the
energy-balance equation refers to [enthalpy of inlet streams -
enthalpy of outlet streams]. Eq. (5.26) applies even if some
proportion of the reactants remains unconverted or if there are
components in the system which do not react. At steady state,
any material added to the system that does not participate in
reaction must leave in the output stream; ignoring enthalpy
effects due to change in temperature or solution and unless
the material volatilises, the enthalpy of unreacted material in
the output stream must be equal to its inlet enthalpy. As sen-
sible heat effects are considered negligible, the difference
between AH~
A/-/n at the reaction temperature can be
ignored.
It must be emphasised that Eq. (5.26) is greatly simplified
and, as discussed in Section 5.8.2, may not be applicable to
single-enzyme conversions. It is, however, a very useful equa-
tion for fermentation processes.
5.11 Fermentation Energy-Balance Worked
Examples
For processes involving cell growth and metabolism the
enthalpy change accompanying reaction is relatively large.
Energy balances for aerobic and anaerobic cultures can there-
fore be carried out using the modified energy-balance
equation (5.26). Because this equation contains no enthalpy
terms, it is not necessary to define reference states. Application
of Eq. (5.26) to anaerobic fermentation is illustrated in
Example 5.7.

In Example 5.7, the water used as solvent for components of
the nutrient medium was ignored. This water was effectively a
tie component, moving through the system unchanged and
not contributing to the energy balance. Cooling requirements
could be determined directly from the heat of reaction.
For aerobic cultures, we can relate the heat of reaction
directly to oxygen consumption, providing a short-cut
method for determining AHrxn. Heats of combustion are not
required in these calculations. Also, as long as the amount of
oxygen consumed is known, the mass balance for the problem
need not be completed. The procedure for energy-balance
problems involving aerobic fermentation is illustrated in
Example 5.8.

Citric acid is manufactured using submerged culture of Aspergi//us niger in a batch reactor operated at 30~ Over a period of two
days, 2500 kg glucose and 860 kg oxygen are consumed to produce 1500 kg citric acid, 500 kg biomass and other products.

5.4 Pre-heating nutrient medium
Steam is used to heat nutrient medium in a continuous-flow
process. Saturated steam at 150~ enters a coil on the outside
of the heating vessel and is completely condensed. Medium
enters the vessel at 15~ and leaves at 44~ Heat losses from
the jacket to the surroundings are estimated as 0.22 kW. If the
flow rate of medium is 3250 kg h-1 and the heat capacity is
Cp-- 0.9 cal g - 1 oC - 1, how much steam is required?
Problems
5.1 Sensible energy change
Calculate the enthalpy change associated with the following
processes:
(a) m-cresol is heated from 25~ to 100~
(b) ethylene glycol is cooled from 20~ to 10~
(c) succinic acid is heated from 15~ to 120~ and
(d) air is cooled from 150~ to 65~
5.2
Heat ofvaporisation
Nitrogen is sometimes bubbled into fermenters to maintain
anaerobic conditions. It does not react, and leaves in the fer-
menter off-gas. However it can strip water from the fermenter,
so that water vapour also leaves in the off-gas. In a continuous
fermenter operated at 33~ 20 g h-1 water is evaporated in
this way. How much heat must be put into the system to com-
pensate for evaporative cooling?
5.5 Production ofglutamic acid
Immobilised
cells of a genetically-improved
strain
of
Brevibacterium lactofermentum are used to convert glucose to
glutamic acid for production of MSG (monosodium gluta-
mate). The immobilised cells are unable to grow, but
metabolise glucose according to the equation:
C6H1206 + N H 3 + 11/2 0 2 ---) C5H9NO 4 -I- C O 2 + 3 H 2 0 .
A feed stream of 4% glucose in water enters a 25 000-1itre
reactor at 25~ at a flow rate of 2000 kg h-1. A gaseous mix-
ture of 12% N H 3 in air is sparged into the reactor at 1 atm and
15~ at a flow rate of 4 vvm (1 vvm means 1 vessel volume per
minute). The product stream from the reactor contains residu-
al sugar at a concentration of 0.5%.

example, assuming the reaction rate remains constant irre-
spective of temperature, if cooling were not provided and
the reactor operated adiabatically, what would be the tem-
perature? (In fact, the rate of conversion will decline
rapidly at high temperatures due to cell death and enzyme
deactivation.)
5.6 Bacterial production ofalginate
Azotobacter vinelandii is investigated for production of
alginate from sucrose. In a continuous fermenter at 28~ with
ammonia as nitrogen source, the yield ofalginate was found to
be 4 g g- l oxygen consumed. It is planned to produce alginate
at a rate of 5 kg h- I. Since the viscosity of alginate in aqueous
solution is considerable, energy input due to mixing the broth
cannot be neglected. The fermenter is equipped with a flat-
bladed disc turbine; at a satisfactory mixing speed and air
flow-rate, power requirements are estimated at 1.5 kW.
Estimate the cooling requirements.
5 . 7 A c i d fermentation
Propionibacterium species are tested for commercial-scale pro-
duction of propionic acid. Propionic and other acids are
synthesised in anaerobic culture using sucrose as substrate and
ammonia as nitrogen source. Overall yields from sucrose are as
follows:

butyric acid
lactic acid

40% (w/w)
20% (w/w)
5% (w/w)
3.4% (w/w)
12% (w/w)
Bacteria are inoculated into a vessel containing sucrose and
ammonia; a total of 30 kg sucrose is consumed over a period of
10 days. What are the cooling requirements?
5.8 Ethanol fermentation
A crude fermenter is set up in a shed in the backyard of a sub-
urban house. Under anaerobic conditions with ammonia as
nitrogen source, about 0.45 g ethanol are formed per g glucose
consumed. At steady state, the production rate of ethanol aver-
ages 0.4 kg h -1.
The owner of this enterprise decides to reduce her electric-
ity bill by using the heat released during the fermentation to
warm water as an adjunct to the household hot-water system.
2.5 litres h - 1 cold water at 10~ is fed into a jacket surround-
ing the fermenter. To what temperature is the water heated?
Heat losses from the system are negligible. Use a biomass com-
position of CH1.75Oo.58No.18 plus 8% ash.
5.9
Production
of bakers' yeast
Bakers' yeast is produced in a 50 000-1itre fermenter under
aerobic conditions. The carbon substrate is sucrose; ammonia
is provided as nitrogen source. The average biomass composi-
tion is CH1.8300.55N0.17 with 5% ash. Under efficient growth
conditions, biomass is the only major product; the biomass
yield from sucrose is 0.5 g g-I. If the specific growth-rate is
0.45 h-l, estimate the rate of heat removal required to main-
tain constant temperature in the fermenter when the yeast
concentration is 10 g l- 1.

Process Energy Balances6
Unsteady-State Material and Energy Balances
An unsteady-state or transientprocess is one which causes system properties to vary with time. Batch and semi-batch systems
are inherently transient; continuous systems are unsteady during start-up and shut-down. Changing from one set of process
conditions to another also creates an unsteady state, as does anyfluctuation in input or control variables.
The principles of mass and energy balances developed in
Chapters 4 and 5 can be applied to unsteady-state processes.
Balance equations are used to determine the rate of change of
system parameters; solution of these equations generally
requires application of calculus. Questions such as what is the
concentration of product in the reactor as a function of time?,
and how long will it take to reach a particular temperature
after flow of steam is started? can be answered using unsteady-
state mass and energy balances. In this chapter we will consider
some simple unsteady-state problems.
6.1 Unsteady-State Material-Balance
Equations
When mass of a system is not constant, we generally need to
know how the mass varies as a function of time. To evaluate
the rate ofchange of mass in the system, let us first return to the
general mass-balance equation introduced in Chapter 4 see
p. 52).

Consider the flow system of Figure 6.1 in which reactions are
taking place. Species A is involved in the process; Mis the mass
of A in the system. Using the 'hat' symbol ~ to denote rate, let
Ag/i be the mass flow rate of A entering the system, and 37/0 the
mass flow rate of A leaving. RG is the mass rate of generation of
species A by chemical reaction; RC is the mass rate of con-
sumption by reaction. The dimensions of 37Ii, 37/o, RG and RC
are M T - 1, with units such as g s- 1, kg h - 1, lb t i n -1, etc.
All of the variables: /17/i, 3//o, RG and Pc, may vary
with time. However, let us focus on an infinitesimally-small

interval of time Atbetween times tand t + At. Even though the
system variables may bechanging, ifAtis sufficiently small we
can treat the flow rates M and rates of reaction Ras if they were
constant during this period. Under these circumstances, the
terms of the general balance equation (4.1) may be written as
follows.
(i)
Mass in. During period At, the mass of species A trans-
ported into the system is M i At. Note that the dimensions
of M i At are M, with units g, kg, lb, etc.
(ii) Mass out. Similarly, the mass of species A transported out
during time At is 340 At.
(iii) Generation. The mass of A generated during Atis RG At.
(iv) Consumption. The mass of A consumed during At is
RcAt.
(v) Accumulation. Let AM be the mass of A accumulated in
the system during At. AM may be either positive (accu-
mulation) or negative (depletion).
Entering these terms into the general mass balance Eq. (4.1)
with the accumulation term on the left-hand side:
AM = 37/iAt - ~
At + R G At - R C At.

(6.2)(6.5)
Eq. (6.2) applies when Atis infinitesimally small. Ifwe take the
limit as Atapproacheszero, i.e. as tand t + Atbecome virtually
the same, Eq. (6.2) represents the system at an instant rather
than over an interval of time. Mathematical techniques for
handling this type of situation are embodied in the rules of cal-
culus. In calculus, the derivativeofywith respect to x, dY/dx, is
defined as:At steady state there can be no change in mass of the system, so
the rate of change, dM/dt must be zero. At steady state, there-
fore, Eq. (6.5) reduces to the familiar steady-state
mass-balance equation (see p. 5 3)"

mass in + mass generated = mass out + mass consumed.
(4.2)
Unsteady-state mass-balance calculations begin with deriva-
tion of a differential equation to describe the process. Eq. (6.5)
was developed on a mass basis and contains parameters such as
mass flow rate M and mass rate of reaction R. Another com-
mon form of the unsteady-state mass balance is based on
volume. The reason for this variation is that reaction rates are
usually expressed on a per-volume basis. For example, the rate
of a first-order reaction is expressed in terms of the concentra-
tion of reactant:
r c = kl CA
where r e is the volumetric rate of consumption ofA by reaction
with units, e.g. g cm -3 s-1, kl is the first-order reaction-rate
constant, and CA is the concentration of reactant A. This and
other reaction-rate equations are described in more detail in
Chapter 11. When rate expressions are used in mass- and
energy-balance problems, the relationship between mass and
volume must enter the analysis. This is illustrated in Example
6.1.
Example 6.1 Unsteady-state material balance for a CSTR
A continuous stirred-tank reactor is operated as shown in Figure 6E 1.1. The volume of liquid in the tank is V. Feed enters with
volumetric flow rate Fii; product leaves with flow rate F o. The concentration of reactant A in the feed is CAi; the concentration of
A in the exit stream is CAo. The density of the feed stream is Pi; the density of the product stream is Po" The tank is well mixed.
The concentration of A in the tank is C A and the density of liquid in the tank is p. In the reactor, compound A undergoes reac-
tion and is transformed into compound B. The volumetric rate of consumption of A by reaction is give by the expression

the definition of density (Section 2.4.1), total mass can be expressed as the product of volume and density. Similarly, mass
flow rate can be expressed as the product of volumetric flow rate and density.

Consider the system shown in Figure 6.2. Eis the total energy
in the system, Ws is the rate at which shaft work is done on the
system, Q is the rate of heat removal from the system, and AT/i
and M o are mass flow rates to and from the system. All these
parameters may vary with time.
Ignoring kinetic and potential energies as discussed in
Section 5.2.1, the energy-balance equation can be applied over
an infinitesimally-small interval of time At, during which we
can treat Ws, Q, M i and A74o as if they were constant. Under
these conditions, the terms of the general energy-balance
equation are:
Input. During time interval At, the amount of energy
entering the system is AT/ihi At + Ws At, where h i is the
specific enthalpy of the incoming flow stream.

system is M o ho At + (~ At.
(iii) Accumulation. Let AE be the energy accumulated in the
system during time At. AE may be either positive (accu-
mulation) or negative (depletion). In the absence of
kinetic and potential energies, E represents the enthalpy

6.3 Solving Differential Equations
As shown in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, unsteady-state mass and
energy balances are represented using differential equations.
Once the differential equation for a particular system has been
found, the equation must be solved to obtain an expression for
mass M or energy E as a function of time. Differential equa-
tions are solved by integration. Some simple rules for
differentiation and integration are outlined in Appendix D.
Of course, there are many more rules of calculus than those
included in Appendix D; however those shown are sufficient
for handling the unsteady-state problems in this chapter.
Further details can be found in any elementary calculus text-
book, or in mathematics handbooks written especially for
biological scientists, e.g. [1-3].
Before we proceed with solution techniques for unsteady-
state mass and energy balances, there are several general points
to consider.
(i)
A differential equation can be solved directly only if it
contains no more than two variables. For mass- and energy-
balance problems, the differential equation must have the
form:
dM
dt
-
f(M,t)
or
dE
--
dt
=
f(E,t)
where f (M, t) represents some function of M and t, and
f (E, t) represents some function of Eand t. The function
may contain constants, but no other variables besides M
and t should appear in the expression for dM/dt, and no
other variables besides E and t should appear in the
expression for dE/dt. Before you attempt to solve these
differential equations, check first that all parameters
except Mand t, or Eand t, are constants.
(ii) Solution of differential equations requires knowledge of
boundary conditions. Boundary conditions contain extra
information about the system. The number of boundary
conditions required depends on the order of the differen-
tial equation, which is equal to the order of the highest
differential coefficient in the equation. For example, if
the equation contains a second derivative, e.g. d2X/dt2, the
equation is second order. All equations developed in this
chapter have been first order; they involve only first order
derivatives of the form dX/dt. One boundary condition is
required to solve a first-order differential equation; two
(iii) Not all differential equations can be solved algebraically,
even if the equation contains only two variables and the
boundary conditions are available. Solution of some
differential equations requires application of numerical
techniques, preferably using a computer. In this chapter
we will be concerned mostly with simple equations that
can be solved using elementary calculus.
The easiest way of solving differential equations is to separate
variables so that each variable appears on only one side of the
equation. For example, consider the simple differential
equation:
dx
- a(b-x)
dt
(6.13)
where a and b are constants. First we must check that the equa-
tion contains only two variables x and t, and that all other
parameters in the equation are constants. Once this is verified,
the equation is separated so that x and t each appear on only
one side of the equation. In the case of Eq. (6.13), this is done
by dividing each side of the equation by (b - x), and multiply-
ing each side by dt:
(b-~) dx = adt.
(6.14)
The equation is now ready for integration:
f
1
dx = f a d t .
(b-x)
(6.15)
Using integration rules (D-28) and (D-24) from Appendix D:
-
In
(b-x)
= a t + K.
(6.16)
Note that the constants of integration from both sides of the
equation have been condensed into one constant/~ this is
valid because a constant • a constant = a constant.6 Unsteady-State Material and Energy Balances

6.4 Solving Unsteady-State Mass Balances
Solution of unsteady-state mass balances is sometimes difficult
unless certain simplifications are made. Because the aim here is
to illustrate application of unsteady-state balances without
becoming too involved in integral calculus, the problems pre-
sented in this section will be relatively simple. For the majority
of problems in this chapter analytical solution is possible.
The following restrictions are common in unsteady-state
mass-balance problems.are the same at all points, this includes the point from
which any product stream is drawn. Accordingly, when
the system is well mixed, properties of the outlet stream
are the same as those within the system.
(ii) Expressions for reaction rate involve the concentration of
only one reactive species. The mass-balance equation for
this species can then be derived and solved; if other
species appear in the kinetic expression this introduces
extra variables into the differential equation making solu-
tion more complex.
The system is well mixed so that properties of the system
do not vary with position. If properties within the systemThe following example illustrates solution of an unsteady-state
mass balance without reaction.

Example 6.2 Dilution of salt solution
1.5 kg salt is dissolved in water to make 100 litres. Pure water runs into a tank containing this solution at a rate of 5 1 min- 1; salt
solution overflows at the same rate. The tank is well mixed. How much salt is in the tank at the end of 15 min? Assume the den-
sity of salt solution is constant and equal to that ofwater.
Solution:

(iii) Assumptions.

---density of salt solution is the same as water
(iv) Boundary conditions.
At the beginning ofthe process, the salt concentration in the tank is 1.5 kg in 100 l, or 0.015 kg l- 1. Ifwe call this initial salt con-
centration CA0, the initial condition is:
at t = 0
CA= CAO= 0.015 kg 1-1.
(1)6 Unsteady-StateMaterial and Energy Balances
116
We also know that the initial volume of liquid in the tank is 100 I. Another initial condition is:
at t = 0
V = V0 = 1001.
(2)
(v) Total mass balance.
The unsteady-state balance equation for total mass was derived in Example 6.1"
d(pV)
=
dt
Fop o.
(6.6)
In this problem we are told that the volumetric flow rates of inlet and outlet streams are equal; therefore F i = Fo. In addition, the
density of the system is constant so that P i - P o - - P" Under these conditions, the terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.6) cancel.
On the left-hand side, because p is constant it can be taken outside of the differential. Therefore:
dV
=0
or
dV
dt
-- 0.
If the derivative of Vwith respect to t is zero, Vmust be a constant:
V=K
where K is the constant of integration. This result means that the volume of the tank is constant and independent of time. Initial
condition (2) tells us that V - 100 1at t - 0; therefore Vmust equal 100 1at all times. Consequently, the constant of integration
Kis equal to 100 l, and the volume ofliquid in the tank does not vary from 100 I.
(vi) Massbalancejgrsah.
The unsteady mass-balance equation for component A such as salt was derived in Example 6.1:
d( VCA)
dt
=
; o G o - k , G v.
(6.7)
In the present problem there is no reaction, so k 1 is zero. Also, F i = Fo = F = 5 1 m i n - 1. Because the tank is well mixed, the con-
centration of salt in the outlet stream is equal to that inside the tank, i.e. Cao - CA. In addition, since the inlet stream does not
contain salt, CAi = 0. From the balance on total mass we know that V is constant and can be placed outside of the differential.
Taking these factors into consideration, Eq. (6.7) becomes:
dCA _ - F C A .
V dt
This differential equation contains only two variables CA and t; Fand Vare constants. The variables are easy to separate by divid-
ing both sides by VCA and multiplying by dt:6 Unsteady-StateMaterial and Energy Balances

Using integration rules (D-27) and (D-24) from Appendix D and combining the constants of integration:

INCA= --~- t + K.
(3)
We have yet to determine the value of K From initial condition (1), at t - 0, CA = CA0. Substituting this information into (3)"
In CA0 = K.
We have thus determined K Substituting this value for K back into (3):
-F
In CA = ~
t + In CA0.
(4)
This is the solution to the mass balance; it gives an expression for concentration of salt in the tank as a function of time. Notice
that ifwe had forgotten to add the constant of integration, the answer would not contain the term In CA0. The equation would
then say that at t = 0, In CA = 0; i.e. CA = 1. We know this is not true; instead, at t = 0, CA = 0.015 kg 1-1, so the result without
the boundary condition is incorrect. It is important to apply boundary conditions every time you integrate.
The solution equation is usually rearranged to give an exponential expression. This is achieved by subtracting In CA0 from
both sides of (4):

In CA - I n CA0 = - - ~ t

II8
We can check that this is the correct solution by taking the derivative of both sides with respect to t and making sure that the
original differential equation is recovered.
For F - 51 m i n - 1, V= 1001 and CA0 - 0.015 kg l- 1, at t = 15 min:
CA= (0.015 kg 1-1) e (-51 min-1/1001)(15 min) = 7.09• 10-3 kg 1-1.
The salt concentration after 15 min is 7.09 x 10 -3 kg l- 1. Therefore:
Mass ofsalt = CA V = (7.09 x 10-3 kg1-1) 1001 = 0.71 kg.
(vii) Finalise.
After 15 min, the mass of salt in the tank is 0.71 kg.
In Example 6.2 the density of the system was assumed con-
stant. This simplified the mathematics of the problem so that
p could be taken outside the differential and cancelled from
the total mass balance. The assumption of constant density is
justified for dilute solutions because the density does not differ
greatly from that of the solvent. The result of the total mass
Example 6.3
balance makes intuitive sense: for a tank with equal flow rates
in and out and constant density, the volume of liquid inside
the tank should remain constant.
The effect of reaction on the unsteady-state mass balance is
illustrated in Example 6.3.
Flow reactor
Rework Example 6.2 to include reaction. Assume that a reaction in the tank consumes salt, at a rate given by the first-order equa-
tion:
r = kl CA
where k I is the first-order reaction constant and CA is the concentration of salt in the tank. Derive an expression for CA as a func-
tion of time. If k I - 0.02 m i n - 1, how long does it take for the concentration of salt to fall to a value 1/20 the initial level?
Solution:
The flowsheet, boundary conditions and assumptions for this problem are the same as in Example 6.2. The total mass balance is
also the same; total mass in the system is unaffected by reaction.

Integrating both sides gives:

where K is the constant of integration. K is determined from initial condition (1) in Example 6.2: at t = 0, CA = CA0.
Substituting these values gives:
In CAo = K
Substituting this value for K back into the answer:
INCA:

or
CAo
For F = 51 m i n - 1, V - 1001, k 1 = 0.02 m i n - 1 and CA/CAo = 1/20' this equation becomes:
ln( ) : ( lmin
1100, - 0.02 min - t t
or

Solving for t:
t = 42.8 min.
(ii) Finalise.
The concentration of salt in the tank reaches 1/20 its initial level after 43 min.
6.5 Solving Unsteady-State Energy Balances
Solution of unsteady-state energy-balance problems can be
mathematically quite complex. In this chapter only problems
with the following characteristics will be treated for ease of
mathematical handling.
(i)
The system has at most one input and one output stream;
furthermore, these streams have the same mass flow rate.
Under these conditions, total mass of the system is constant.
(ii) The system is well mixed with uniform temperature and
composition. Properties of the outlet stream are therefore
the same as within the system.
(iii) No chemical reactions or phase changes occur.
(iv) Mixtures and solutions are ideal.
(v) Heat capacities of the system contents and inlet and
outlet streams are independent of composition and tem-
perature, and therefore invariant with time.6 Unsteady-StateMaterial and Energy Balances
I::l,O
(vi) Internal energy U and enthalpy H are independent of
pressure.
The principles and equations for unsteady-state energy bal-
ances are entirely valid when these conditions are not met; the
only difference is that solution of the differential equation is
greatly simplified for systems with the above characteristics.
The procedure for solution of unsteady-state energy balances
is illustrated in Example 6.4.
Example 6.4 Solvent heater
An electric heating-coil is immersed in a stirred tank. Solvent at 15~ with heat capacity 2.1 kJ kg- 1 oC - 1 is fed into the tank at
a rate of 15 kg h - 1. Heated solvent is discharged at the same flow rate. The tank is filled initially with 125 kg cold solvent at
10~ The rate of heating by the electric coil is 800 W. Calculate the time required for the temperature of the solvent to reach
60~

If the tank is well mixed, the temperature of the outlet stream is the same as inside the tank. Let T be the temperature in the tank;
Ti is the temperature of the incoming stream, Mis the mass of solvent in the tank, and M is the mass flow rate of solvent to and
from the tank.

(vi) Massbalance.
Since the mass flow rates of solvent to and from the tank are equal, the mass Mofsolvent inside the tank is constant and equal to
the initial value, 12 5 kg. The mass balance is therefore complete.
(vii) Energybalance.
The unsteady-state energy-balance equation for two flow streams is given by Eq. (6.10):
dE
dt
- & h , - & h o - O+ es.
In the absence of phase change, reaction and heats of mixing, the enthalpies of input and output streams can be determined from
sensible heats only. Similarly, any change in the energy content of the system must be due to change in temperature and sensible
heat. With solvent enthalpy defined as zero at Tref, change in Ecan be calculated from the difference between the system temper-
ature and Tref. Therefore, the terms of the energy-balance equation are:

analysis;

Fluid Flow and Mixing
Fluid mechanics is an important area of engineering science. The nature offlow in pipes, pumps and reactors depends on the
power input to the system and the physical characteristics of the fluid. In fermenters, fluid properties affectprocess energy
requirements and the effectiveness of mixing, which can have a dramatic influence on productivity and the success of equip-
ment scale-up. As we shall see in the following chapters, transport of heat and mass is often coupled with fluid flow. To
understand the mechanisms of these important transportprocesses, we must flrst examine the behaviour offluid near surfaces
and interfaces. Fluids in bioprocessing often contain suspended solids, consist of more than one phase, and have
non-Newtonian properties. All of thesefeatures complicate analysis offlow behaviour and present many challenges in
bioprocess design.
Fluid dynamics accounts for a substantial fraction of the
chemical engineering literature. Accordingly, complete treat-
ment of the subject is beyond the scope of this book. Here, we
content ourselves with study of those aspects of flow behaviour
particularly relevant to fermentation fluids. Further informa-
tion can be found in the references at the end of the chapter.
which is incompressible and has zero viscosity. The term invis-
cid applies to fluids with zero viscosity. All real fluids have
finite viscosity and are therefore called viscidor viscous fluids.
Fluids can be classified further as Newtonian or non-
Newtonian. This distinction is explained in detail in Sections
7.3 and 7.5.
7.1 Classification of Fluids
A fluid is a substance which undergoes continuous deformation
when subjected to a shearingforce. A simple shearing force is one
which causes thin parallel plates to slide over each other, as in a
pack of cards. Shear can also occur in other geometries; the
effect of shear force in planar and rotational systems is illus-
trated in Figure 7.1. Shear forces in these examples cause
deformation, which is a change in the relative positions of parts
of a body. A shear force must be applied to produce fluid flow.
According to the above definition, fluids can be either gases
or liquids. Two physical properties, viscosity and density, are
used to classify fluids. If the density of a fluid changes with
pressure, the fluid is compressible. Gases are generally classed as
compressible fluids. The density of liquids is practically
independent of pressure; liquids are incompressible fluids.
Sometimes the distinction between compressible and incom-
pressible fluid is not well defined; for example, a gas may be
treated as incompressible if variations of pressure and tempera-
ture are small.
Fluids are also classified on the basis of viscosity. Viscosity
is the property of fluids responsible for internal friction during
flow. An ideal or perfect fluid is a hypothetical liquid or gas

lowing sections.

7.2.1 Streamlines
v
When a fluid flows through a pipe or over a solid object, the
velocity of the fluid varies depending on position. One way of
representing variation in velocity is streamlines, which follow
the flow path. Constant velocity is shown by equidistant spac-
ing of parallel streamlines as shown in Figure 7.2(a). The
velocity profile for slow-moving fluid flowing over a sub-
merged object is shown in Figure 7.2(b); reduced spacing
between the streamlines indicates that the velocity at the top
and bottom of the object is greater than at the front and back.
Streamlines show only the net effect of fluid motion;
although streamlines suggest smooth continuous flow, fluid
molecules may actually be moving in an erratic fashion. The
slower the flow the more closely the streamlines represent
actual motion. Slow fluid flow is therefore called streamline or
laminar flow. In fast motion, fluid particles frequently cross
and recross the streamlines. This motion is called turbulent
flow and is characterised by formation of eddies.

Reynolds Number
Transition from laminar to turbulent flow depends not only
on the velocity of the fluid, but also on its viscosity and density
and the geometry of the flow conduit. A parameter used to
characterise fluid flow is the Reynolds number. For full flow in
pipes with circular cross-section, Reynolds number Re is
defined as:
Re=
Dup
(7.1)
where D is pipe diameter, u is average linear velocity of the
fluid, p is fluid density, and )u is fluid viscosity. For stirred ves-
sels there is another definition of Reynolds number:
Ni D2p
Re i =
(7.2)
where Re i is the impeller Reynolds number, N i is stirrer speed,
D i is impeller diameter, p is fluid density and/r is fluid viscosity.
The Reynolds number is a dimensionless variable; the units
and dimensions of the parameters in Eqs (7.1) and (7.2) cancel
completely.
Reynolds number is named after Osborne Reynolds, who
published in 1883 a classical series of papers on the nature of
flow in pipes. One of the most significant outcomes of
Reynolds' experiments is that there is a critical Reynolds num-
berwhich marks the upper boundary for laminar flow in pipes.
In smooth pipes, laminar flow is encountered at Reynolds
numbers less than 2100. Under normal conditions, flow is
turbulent at Re above about 4000. Between 2100 and 4000 is
the transition region where flow may be either laminar or tur-
bulent depending on conditions at the entrance of the pipe
and other variables. Flow in stirred tanks may also be laminar
or turbulent as a function of the impeller Reynolds number.7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
I3I
The value of R e i marking the transition between these flow
regimes depends on the geometry of the impeller and tank; for
several commonly-used mixing systems, laminar flow is found
at Rei ~< 10.
7.2.3
Hydrodynamic
Boundary Layers
In most practical applications, fluid flow occurs in the pres-
ence of a stationary solid surface, such as the walls of a pipe or
tank. That part of the fluid where flow is affected by the solid is
called the boundary layer. As an example, consider flow of fluid
parallel to the flat plate shown in Figure 7.3. Contact between
the moving fluid and the plate causes formation of a boundary
layer beginning at the leading edge and developing on b o t h
top and bottom of the plate. Figure 7.3 shows only the upper
stream; fluid motion below the plate will be a mirror image of
that above.
As indicated by the arrows in Figure 7.3(a), the bulk fluid
velocity in front of the plate is uniform and of magnitude u B.
The extent of the boundary layer is indicated by the broken
Figure 7.3 Fluid boundary layer for flow over a flat plate.
(a) The boundary layer forms at the leading edge.
(b) Compared with velocity u B in the bulk fluid, velocity in the
boundary layer is zero at the plate surface but increases with
distance from the plate to reach u B near the outer limit of the
boundary layer.
line. Above the boundary layer, fluid motion is the same as if
the plate were not there. The boundary layer grows in thick-
ness from the leading edge until it develops its full size. Final
thickness of the boundary layer depends on the Reynolds
number for bulk flow.
When fluid flows over a stationary object, a thin film of
fluid in contact with the surface adheres to it to prevent slip-
page over the surface. Fluid velocity at the surface of the plate
in Figure 7.3 is therefore zero. When part of a flowing fluid has
been brought to rest, the flow of adjacent fluid layers is slowed
down by the action of viscous drag. This phenomenon is illus-
trated in Figure 7.3(b). Velocity of fluid within the boundary
layer, u, is represented by arrows; u is zero at the surface of the
plate. Viscous drag forces are transmitted upwards through the
fluid from the stationary layer at the surface. The fluid layer
just above the surface moves at a slow but finite velocity; layers
further above move at increasing velocity as the drag forces
associated with the stationary layer decrease. At the edge of the
boundary layer, fluid is unaffected by the presence of the plate
and the velocity is close to that of the bulk flow, u B. The mag-
nitude of u at various points in the boundary layer is indicated
in Figure 7.3(b) by the length of the arrows in the direction of
flow. The line connecting the heads of the velocity arrows
shows the velocity profile in the fluid. A velocity gradient, i.e. a
change in velocity with distance from the plate, is thus estab-
lished in a direction perpendicular to the direction of flow.
The velocity gradient forms as the drag force resulting from
retardation of fluid at the surface is transmitted through the
fluid.
Formation of boundary layers is important not only in
determining characteristics of fluid flow, but also for transfer
of heat and mass between phases. These topics are discussed
further in Chapters 8 and 9.
7.2.4 Boundary-Layer
Separation
What happens when contact is broken between a fluid and a
solid immersed in the flow path? As an example, consider a flat
plate aligned perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow, as
shown in Figure 7.4. Fluid impinges on the surface of the
plate, and forms a boundary layer as it flows either up or down
the object. When fluid reaches the top or bottom of the plate
its momentum prevents it from making the sharp turn around
the edge. As a result, fluid separates from the plate and
proceeds outwards into the bulk fluid. Directly behind the
plate is a zone of highly decelerating fluid in which large eddies
or vortices are formed. This zone is called the wake. Eddies in
the wake are kept in rotational motion by the force of border-
ing currents.7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

the direction of flow. (From W.L. McCabe and J.C. Smith,
1976, Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering, 3rd edn,
McGraw-Hill, Tokyo.)Figure 7.5 Velocity profile for Couette flow between
parallel plates.
Boundary-layer separation such as that shown in Figure 7.4
occurs whenever an abrupt change in either magnitude or direc-
tion of fluid velocity is too great for the fluid to keep to a solid
surface. It occurs in sudden contractions, expansions or bends in
the flow channel, or when an object is placed across the flow
path. Considerable energy is associated with the wake; this
energy is taken from the bulk flow. Formation of wakes should
be minimised if large pressure losses in the fluid are to be avoided;
however, for some purposes such as promotion of mixing and
heat transfer, boundary-layer separation may be desirable.into motion, but with reduced speed. Layers further above also
move; however, as we get closer to the top plate, the fluid is
affected by viscous drag from the stationary film attached to
the upper plate surface. As a consequence, fluid velocity
between the plates decreases from that of the moving plate at
y = O, to zero at y = D. The velocity at different levels between
the plates is indicated in Figure 7.5 by the arrows marked v.
Laminar flow due to a moving surface as shown in Figure 7.5 is
called Couetteflow.
When steady Couette flow is attained in simple fluids, the
velocity profile is as indicated in Figure 7.5; the slope of the
line connecting all the velocity arrows is constant and propor-
tional to the shear force Fresponsible for motion of the plate.
The slope of the line connecting the velocity arrows is the
velocity gradient, dV/dy. When the magnitude of the velocity
gradient is directly proportional to F, we can write:
7.3 Viscosity
Viscosity is the most important property affecting flow behavi-
our of a fluid; viscosity is related to the fluid's resistance to
motion. Viscosity has a marked effect on pumping, mixing,
mass transfer, heat transfer and aeration of fluids; these in turn
exert a major influence on bioprocess design and economics.
Viscosity of fermentation fluids is affected by the presence of
cells, substrates, products and air.
Viscosity is an important aspect of rheology, the science of
deformation and flow. Viscosity is determined by relating the
velocity gradient in fluids to the shear force causing flow to
occur. This relationship can be explained by considering the
development of laminar flow between parallel plates, as shown
in Figure 7.5. The plates are a relatively short distance apart
and, initially, the fluid between them is stationary. The lower
plate is then moved steadily to the right with shear force F,
while the upper plate remains fixed.
A thin film of fluid adheres to the surface of each plate.
Therefore as the lower plate moves, fluid moves with it, while
at the surface of the stationary plate the fluid velocity is zero.
Due to viscous drag, fluid just above the moving plate is set

(7.6)
where/~ is the proportionality constant. Eq. (7.6) is called
Newton's law of viscosity, and ju is the viscosity. The minus sign
is necessary in Eq. (7.6) because the velocity gradient is always
negative if the direction of F, and therefore r, is considered
positive. -dV/dy is called the shear rate, and is usually denoted
by the symbol 3~.
Viscosity as defined in Eq. (7.6) is sometimes called dynamic
viscosity. As "r has dimensions L - I M T -2 and 3~ has dimen-
sions T - 1,/4 must therefore have dimensions L- IMT- 1. The
SI unit of viscosity is the Pascal second (Pa s), which is equal to
1 N s m -2 or 1 kg m-1 S-1. Other units include centipoise,
cP. Direct conversion factors for viscosity units are given in
Table A.9 in Appendix A. The viscosity of water at 20~ is
approximately 1 cP or 10 -3 Pa s. A modified form ofviscosity
is the kinematic viscosity, defined as tqp where p is fluid den-
sity; kinematic viscosity is usually given the symbol v.
Fluids which obey Eq. (7.6) with constant/~ are known as
Newtonianfluids. The flow curve or rheogram for a Newtonian
fluid is shown in Figure 7.6; the slope of a plot of ~" versus ~ is
constant and equal to ju. The viscosity of Newtonian fluids
remains constant despite changes in shear stress (force applied)
or shear rate (velocity gradient). This does not imply that the
viscosity is invariant; viscosity depends on many parameters
such as temperature, pressure and fluid composition.
However, under a given set of these conditions, viscosity of
Newtonian fluids is independent of shear stress and shear rate.
On the other hand, the ratio between shear stress and shear
rate is not constant for non-Newtonian fluids, but depends on
the shear force exerted on the fluid. Accordingly,/u in Eq. (7.6)
is not a constant, and the velocity profile during Couette flow
is not as simple as that shown in Figure 7.5.
7.4 Momentum Transfer
Viscous drag forces responsible for the velocity gradient in
Figure 7.5 are the instrument of momentum transfer in fluids.
At y = 0 the fluid acquires momentum in the x-direction due
to motion of the lower plate. This fluid imparts some of its
momentum to the adjacent layer of fluid above the plate, caus-
ing it also to move in the x-direction. Momentum in the
x-direction is thus transmitted through the fluid in the y-
direction.
Momentum transfer in fluids is represented by Eq. (7.6).
....-
To interpret this equation in terms of momentum transfer,
shear stress "ris considered as the flux of x-momentum in the y-
direction. The validity of this definition can be verified by
checking the dimensions of momentum flux and shear stress.
Momentum is given by the expression Mvwhere Mis mass
and v is velocity; momentum has dimensions LMT-1. Flux
means rateper unit area; therefore momentum flux has dimen-
sions L- 1MT- 2, which are also the dimensions of'r. So with
representing momentum flux, according to Eq. (7.6), flux of
momentum is directly proportional to the velocity gradient
dV/dy. The negative sign in Eq. (7.6) means that momentum is
transferred from regions of high velocity to regions of low
velocity, i.e. in a direction opposite to the direction of increas-
ing velocity. The magnitude of the velocity gradient dVldy
determines the magnitude of the momentum flux; dV/dy thus
acts as the 'driving force' for momentum transfer.
Interpretation of fluid flow as momentum transfer perpen-
dicular to the direction of flow may seem peculiar at first. The
reason it is mentioned here is that there are many parallels
between momentum transfer, heat transfer and mass transfer
in terms of mechanism and equations. The analogy between
these physical processes will be discussed further in Chapters 8
and 9.
7.5 Non-Newtonian Fluids
Most slurries, suspensions and dispersions are non-
Newtonian, as are homogeneous solutions of long-chain
polymers and other large molecules. Many fermentation7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
134
processes involve materials which exhibit non-Newtonian
behaviour, such as starches, extracellular polysaccharides, and
culture broths containing cell suspensions or pellets. Examples
ofnon-Newtonian fluids are listed in Table 7.1.
Classification of non-Newtonian fluids depends on the
relationship between the shear stress imposed on the fluid and
the shear rate developed. Common types of non-Newtonian
fluid include pseudoplastic, dilatant, Bingham plastic and
Casson plastic; flow curves for these materials are shown in
Figure 7.7. In each case, the ratio between shear stress and
shear rate is not constant; nevertheless, this ratio for non-
Newtonian fluids is often called the apparent viscosity, t~a.
Apparent viscosity is not a physical property of the fluid in the
same way as Newtonian viscosity; it is dependent on the shear
force exerted on the fluid. It is therefore meaningless to specify
the apparent viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid without
noting the shear stress or shear rate at which it was measured.
7.5.1 Two-Parameter Models
and n is the flow behaviour index. The parameters Kand n char-
acterise the rheology of power-law fluids. The flow behaviour
index n is dimensionless; the dimensions of K, L - I M T n-2,
depend on n. As indicated in Figure 7.7, when n < 1 the fluid
exhibits pseudoplastic behaviour; when n > 1 the fluid is dila-
tant. n = 1 corresponds to Newtonian behaviour. For
power-law fluids, apparent viscosity jua is expressed as:
jUa=
T
_
=
K~ " - 1 .
(7.8)
For pseudoplastic fluids n < 1 and the apparent viscosity
decreases with increasing shear rate; these fluids are said to
exhibit shear thinning. On the other hand, apparent viscosity
increases with shear rate for dilatant or shear thickeningfluids.
Also included in Figure 7.7 are flow curves for plastic flow.
Some fluids do not produce motion until some finite yield
stress has been applied. For Binghamplastic fluids:

(7.10)
Once the yield stress is exceeded, the behaviour of Casson
fluids is pseudoplastic. Several other equations describing
non-Newtonian flow have also been developed [ 1].
7.5.2 Time-Dependent Viscosity
W h e n a shear force is exerted on some fluids, the apparent vis-
cosity either increases or decreases with duration of the force.
If apparent viscosity increases with time, the fluid is said to be
rheapectic; rheopectic fluids are relatively rare in occurrence. If
apparent viscosity decreases with time the fluid is thixotropic.
Thixotropic behaviour is not u n c o m m o n in cultures contain-
ing fungal mycelia or extracellular microbial polysaccharides,7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
and appears to be related to reversible 'structure' effects associ-
ated with the orientation of cells and macromolecules in the
fluid. Rheological properties vary during application of the
shear force because it takes time for equilibrium to be estab-
lished between structure breakdown and re-development.

7.5.3 Viscoelasticity
Viscoelastic fluids, such as some polymer solutions, exhibit an
elastic response to changes in shear stress. When shear forces are
removed from a moving viscoelastic fluid, the direction of flow
may be reversed due to elastic forces developed during flow.
Most viscoelastic fluids are also pseudoplastic and may exhibit
other rheological characteristics such as yield stress. Mathe-
matical analysis of viscoelasticity is therefore quite complex.

7.6 Viscosity Measurement
Many different instruments or viscometers are available for
measurement ofrheological properties. Space does not permit a
detailed discussion of viscosity measurement in this text;
further information can be found elsewhere [1-5]. Specifi-
cations for commercial viscometers are also available [2, 3, 6].
The objective of any viscosity measurement system is to
create a controlled flow situation where easily measured
parameters can be related to the shear stress I'and shear rate $ .
Usually the fluid is set in rotational motion and the parameters
measured are torque M and angular velocity/2. These quan-
tities are used to calculate ~'and 3~ using approximate formulae
which depend on the geometry of the apparatus. Once
obtained, ~"and "2 are applied for evaluation of viscosity in
Newtonian fluids, or viscosity parameters such as K, n, and ~'0
for non-Newtonian fluids. Equations for particular viscometers
can be found in other texts [2, 3, 6]. Most modern viscometers
use microprocessors to provide automatic read-out of
parameters such as shear stress, shear rate and apparent viscosity.
Three types ofviscometer commonly used in bioprocessing
applications are the cone-and-plate viscometer, the coaxial-
cylinder rotary viscometer, and the impeller viscometer.
is generally assumed that the fluid undergoes streamline flow in
concentric circles about the axis of rotation of the cone. This
assumption is not always valid; however for r less than about
3~, the error is small. Temperature can be controlled by circu-
lating water from a constant-temperature bath beneath the
plate; this is effective provided the speed of rotation is not too
high. Limitations of the cone-and-plate method for measure-
ment of flow properties, including corrections for edge and
temperature effects and turbulence, are discussed elsewhere [3].
7.6.2 Coaxial-Cylinder Rotary Viscometer
The coaxial-cylinder viscometer is a popular rotational device
for measuring rheological properties. A typical coaxial-
cylinder instrument is shown in Figure 7.9. This device is
designed to shear fluid located in the annulus between two

The cone-and-plate viscometer consists of a flat horizontal
plate and an inverted cone, the apex of which is near contact
with the plate as shown in Figure 7.8. The angle ~ between the
plate and cone is very small, usually less than 3 ~, and the fluid to
be measured is located in this small gap. Large cone angles are
not used for routine work for a variety of reasons, the most
important being that analysis of the results for non-Newtonian
fluids would be complex or impossible. The cone is rotated in
the fluid, and the angular velocity/2 and torque Mmeasured. It

other rotates. A cylindrical bob of radius R i is suspended in
sample fluid held in a stationary cylindrical cup of radius Ro.
Liquid covers the bob to a height h from the bottom of the
outer cup. AS the inner cylinder rotates, the angular velocity/2
and torque Mare measured. In some designs the outer cylinder
rather than the inner bob rotates; in any case the motion is
relative with magnitude/2.
Coaxial-cylinder viscometers are used with Newtonian or
non-Newtonian fluids. When flow is non-Newtonian, shear
rate is not related simply to rotational speed and geometric fac-
tors and the calculations can be somewhat complicated.
Limitations of the coaxial-cylinder method, including correc-
tions for end effects, slippage, temperature variation and
turbulence, are discussed elsewhere [2, 3, 6].

with standard rotational viscometers, modified apparatus
employing turbine and other impellers have been developed
for rheological study of fermentation fluids [7, 8]. Instead of
the rotating inner cylinder of Figure 7.9, a small impeller on a
stirring shaft is used to shear the fluid sample. As the impeller
rotates slowly in the fluid, accurate measurements of torque M
and rotational speed N i are made. For a turbine impeller under
laminar-flow conditions, the following relationships apply [8]:
5' = k N i
(7.11)
and
T-
2xMk
64D~
(7.12)
where D i is the impeller diameter and k is a constant which
depends on the geometry of the impeller (see Section 7.13).
The relationship of Eq. (7.11) is experimentally derived; for
turbine impellers k is approximately 10. The exact value of k
for a particular apparatus is evaluated using liquid with a
known viscosity-shear rate relationship.
Because Eqs (7.11) and (7.12) are valid only for laminar
flow, viscosity measurements using the impeller method must
be carried out under laminar flow conditions. Accordingly, if a
turbine impeller is used, R e i should not be greater than about
10. As Re i is directly proportional to N i which, from Eq.
(7.11), determines the value of 3~, the necessity for laminar flow
limits the range of shear rates that may be investigated. This
range can be extended if anchor or helical agitators are used
instead of the conventional disc turbine (see Figure 7.15 for
illustrations of these impellers). Laminar flow is maintained at
higher R e i with anchor and helical impellers; the value of k in
Eq. (7.11) is also greater so that higher shear rates can be tested.
As Eq. (7.12) is valid only for turbine impellers, the relation-
ship between ," and Mmust be modified if alternative impellers
are used. Application of anchor and helical impellers for viscos-
ity measurement is described in the literature [9, 10].
Because the flow patterns in stirred fluids are relatively
complex, analysis of data from impeller viscometers is not
absolutely rigorous from a rheological point ofview. However,
the procedure is based on well-proven and widely-accepted
empirical correlations and is considered the most reliable tech-
nique for mycelial broths. As discussed below, the method
eliminates many of the operating problems associated with
conventional viscometers for study of fermentation fluids.
7.6.4
Use of Viscometers With Fermentation
Broths
Measurement of rheological properties is difficult when the
fluid contains suspended solids such as cells. Viscosity of fer-
mentation broths often appears time-dependent due to
artifacts associated with the measuring device. With viscome-
ters such as the cone-and-plate and coaxial cylinder, the
following problems can arise:
(i)
the suspension is effectively centrifuged in the viscometer
so that a region with lower cell density is formed near the
rotating surface;
(ii) solids settle out of suspension during measurement;
(iii) large particles about the same size as the gap in the coaxial
viscometer, or about the same size as the cone angle in the
cone-and-plate, interfere with accurate measurement;
(iv) the measurement will depend somewhat on the orienta-
tion of particles in the flow field;
(v) some types of particle will begin to flocculate or de-
flocculate when the shear field is applied; and
(vi) particles can be destroyed during measurement.
The first problem is particularly troublesome because it is hard
to detect and can give viscosity results which are too small by a
factor of up to 100. For suspensions containing solids, the
impeller method offers significant advantages compared with
other measurement procedures. Stirring by the impeller pre-
vents sedimentation, promotes uniform distribution of solids
through the fluid, and reduces time-dependent changes in sus-
pension composition. The method has proved very useful for
theological measurements on microbial suspensions [5].7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

7.7 Rheological Properties of Fermentation
Broths
Rheological data have been reported for a range of fermentation
fluids. This information has been obtained using various vis-
cometers and measurement techniques; however, operating
problems such as particle settling and broth centrifugation have
been ignored in many cases. Most mycelial suspensions have
been modelled as pseudoplastic fluids or, if there is a yield stress,
Bingham or Casson plastic. On the other hand, the rheology of
dilute broths and cultures of yeast and non-chain-forming bac-
teria is usually Newtonian. Rheological properties of some
microbial and plant-cell suspensions are listed in Table 7.2. In
most cases, the results are valid over only a limited range of shear
conditions which is largely dictated by the choice ofviscometer.
When the fermentation produces extracellular polymers such as
in microbial production of pullulan and xanthan, the rheo-
logical characteristics of the broth depend strongly on the prop-
erties and concentration of these materials.
7.8 Factors Affecting Broth Viscosity
The rheology of fermentation broths often changes through-
out batch culture. For broths obeying the power law, the flow
behaviour index n and consistency index K can vary substan-
tially depending on culture time. As an example, Figure 7.10
Shows changes in n and K during batch culture of Endomyces
[15]; the culture starts off Newtonian (n = 1) but quickly
becomes pseudoplastic (n < 1). K rises steadily throughout
most of the batch period; this gives a direct indication of the
increase in apparent viscosity since, as indicated in Eq. (7.8),
~a is directly proportional to K.
Changes in rheology of fermentation broths are caused by
variation of one or more of the following properties:

(vii) rate ofshear.
Some of these parameters are considered below.
7.8.1
Cell Concentration
The viscosity of a suspension of spheres in Newtonian liquid
can be predicted using the Vand equation:
/~ = / ~ (1 + 2.5~r + 7.25~r 2)
(7.13)7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
140
where 1,/Lis the viscosity of the suspending liquid and ~ is the
volume fraction of solids. Eq. (7.13) has been found to hold
for yeast and spore suspensions up to 14 vol% solids [21].
Many other cell suspensions do not obey Eq. (7.13); cell con-
centration can have a much stronger influence on rheological
properties than is predicted by the Vand equation. As an
example, Figure 7.11 shows how cell concentration affects the
apparent viscosity of various pseudoplastic plant-cell suspen-
sions [22]; a doubling in cell concentration causes the
apparent viscosity to increase by a factor of up to 90. Similar
results have been found for mould pellets in liquid culture
[23]. When viscosity is so strongly dependent on cell concen-
tration, a steep drop in viscosity can be achieved by diluting
the broth with water or medium. Periodic removal of part of
the culture and refilling with fresh medium reduces the vis-
cosity and improves fluid flow in viscous fermentations.
7.8.2 Cell Morphology
Morphological characteristics exert a profound influence on
broth rheology. Disperse filamentous growth produces 'struc-
ture' in the broth, resulting in pseudoplasticity, yield-stress
behaviour, or both. On the other hand, broths containing pel-
leted cells tends to be more Newtonian, depending on how

7.8.3 Osmotic Pressure
Osmotic pressure of the culture medium affects cell turgor
pressure. This in turn affects the hyphal flexibility of filamen-
tous cells; increased osmotic pressure gives a lower turgor
pressure making the hyphae more flexible. Improved hyphal
flexibility reduces broth viscosity, and can also have a marked
effect on yield stress.
7.8.4 Product and Substrate Concentrations
When the product of fermentation is a polymer, continued
excretion in batch culture raises the broth viscosity. For
example, during production of exopolysaccharide by
Aureobasidium pullulans, apparent viscosity measured at a
shear rate of 1 s-1 can reach as high as 24 000 cP [18]. Cell
concentration usually has a negligible effect on overall viscos-
ity in these fermentations; the rheological properties of the
fluid are dominated by the dissolved polymer. Other products
having a similar effect on culture rheology include dextran,
alginate and xanthan gum.
In contrast, when the fermentation medium contains poly-
meric substrate such as starch, apparent viscosity will decrease
as the fermentation progresses and the polymer is broken
down. There could also be a progressive change from
non-Newtonian to Newtonian behaviour. In mycelial fermen-
tations this change is usually short lived; as the cells grow and
develop a structured filamentous network, the broth becomes
increasingly pseudoplastic and viscous.

readily the pellets are deformed during flow. The extent of
branching of hyphal cells can also affect rheology; cells with a
high branching frequency are generally less flexible than non-
branching cells and produce higher viscosities.
Sample rheological data for pseudoplastic mycelial broths
are shown in Figure 7.12 [9]. Pelleted mycelia are more closely
Newtonian in behaviour than filamentous cells; the flow beha-
viour index n for pellets is closer to unity. As indicated in
Figure 7.12(b), the consistency index, and therefore the appar-
ent viscosity, can differ by several orders of magnitude
depending on cell morphology.

7.9 Mixing
Mixing is a physical operation which reduces non-
uniformities in fluid by eliminating gradients of concen-
tration, temperature and other properties. Mixing is accom-
plished by interchanging material between different locations
to produce a mingling of components. If a system is perfectly7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

mixed, there is a random homogeneous distribution of system
properties. Mixing involves:
(i)
blending soluble components of the medium such as
sugars;
(ii) dispersing gases such as air through the liquid in the form
of small bubbles;
(iii) maintaining suspension of solid particles such as cells;
(iv) where necessary, dispersing immiscible liquids to form an
emulsion or suspension of fine drops; and
(v) promoting heat transfer to or from the liquid.
Mixing is one of the most important operations in bioprocess-
ing. To create the optimal environment for fermentation,
bioreactors must provide the cells access to all substrates,
including oxygen in aerobic culture. It is not enough to just fill
the fermenter with nutrient-rich medium; unless the culture is
mixed, zones of nutrient depletion will develop as the cells
rapidly consume the materials they need. This problem is
heightened if mixing does not maintain a uniform suspension
of biomass; substrat.e concentrations can quickly drop to zero
in areas where cells settle out of suspension. Another import-

ant function of mixing is heat transfer. Bioreactors must be
capable of transferring heat to or from the broth rapidly
enough so that the desired temperature is maintained. Cooling
water is used to take up excess heat from fermentations; the
rate of heat transfer from the broth through the walls of the
vessel to the cooling water depends on mixing conditions in
the vessel. The effectiveness of mixing depends in turn on the
rheological properties of the culture fluid.
Mixing can be achieved in many different ways. In this
chapter we will concentrate on the most common mixing
technique in bioprocessing: mechanical agitation using an
impeller.
7.9.1
Mixing Equipment
Mixing is usually carried out in a stirred tank, such as that
shown in Figure 7.13. Stirred tanks are usually cylindrical in
shape. If possible, the base of the tank is rounded at the edges
rather than angled; this eliminates sharp corners and pockets
into which fluid currents may not penetrate and discourages
formation of stagnant regions. Mixing is achieved using an7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
impeller mounted in the tank; for use with Newtonian fluids,
the ratio of tank diameter to impeller diameter is normally
about 3:1. The impeller is usually positioned overhead on a
centrally-located stirrer shaft. Sometimes, stirrer shafts are
designed to enter at the bottom of the vessel; the disadvantage
of this arrangement is that leaks can develop if the seal between
the shaft and the tank floor is not perfect. The stirrer shaft is
driven rapidly by the stirrer motor; the effect of the rotating
impeller is to pump the liquid and create a regular flow pattern.
Liquid is forced away from the impeller, circulates through the
vessel, and periodically returns to the impeller region. For effi-
cient mixing with a single impeller, the depth of liquid in the
tank should be no more than 1.0-1.25 times the tank diameter.
Baffles, which are vertical strips of metal mounted against
the wall of the tank, are installed to reduce vortexing and swirl-
ing of the liquid. Baffles are attached to the tank by means of
welded brackets; four equally-spaced baffles are usually suffi-
cient to prevent vortex formation. The optimum baffle width
depends on the impeller design and fluid viscosity but is of the
order 1/10-1/12 the tank diameter. For low-viscosity liquids,
baffles are usually attached perpendicular to the wall as illus-
trated in Figure 7.14(a). Alternatively, as shown in Figures
7.14(b) and (c), baffles can be mounted away from the wall
with a clearance of about 1/50 the tank diameter, or set at an
angle. These arrangements prevent sedimentation and devel-
opment of stagnant zones at the inner edge of the baffle during
mixing of viscous cell suspensions.
Many impeller designs are available for mixing applica-
tions; a small selection is illustrated in Figure 7.15. Further
details and descriptions of impellers can be found elsewhere
[24, 25]. Some impellers have flat blades; in others such as the

propeller and helical screw, the slope of the individual blades
varies continuously. Specification of the pitch of a propeller
blade refers to its properties as a segment of a screw; pitch is the
advance per revolution. Choice of impeller depends on several
factors, including viscosity of the liquid to be mixed and sensi-
tivity of the system to mechanical shear. The recommended
viscosity ranges for a number of common impellers are indi-
cated in Figure 7.16. For low-to-medium-viscosity liquids,
propellers and flat-blade turbines are recommended. The most
frequently-used impeller in the fermentation industry is the 6-
flat-blade disc-mounted turbine shown in Figure 7.15; this
impeller is also known as the Rushton turbine.

7.9.2 Flow Patterns in Agitated Tanks
The flow pattern in an agitated tank depends on the impeller
design, the properties of the fluid, and the size and geometric
proportions of the vessel, baffles and agitator.
9Although most stirrers are rotational in action, simple cir-
cular flow of liquid around the shaft such as that illustrated in
Figure 7.17(a) is generally disadvantageous and should be
avoided. In circular flow, liquid moves in a streamline fashion
and there is little mixing between fluid at different heights in
the tank. Circular flow also leads to vortex development as
shown in Figure 7.17(b). At high impeller speeds, the vortex
may reach down to the impeller so that gas from the surround-
ing atmosphere is drawn into the liquid; this is generally
undesirable as it produces very high mechanical stresses in the
stirrer shaft, bearings and seal. Prevention of circular flow has a
high priority in design of mixing systems, and is usually
achieved by installing baffles which interrupt the circular flow
pattern and create turbulence in the fluid.
As well as circular flow, motion of fluid occurs in the radial
direction (i.e. from the stirrer out to the sides of the tank and7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
I~
back again) and in the axial direction (i.e. up and down the
height of the tank). Axial and radial flows are generated at the
impeller, and it is these components of fluid motion which are
primarily responsible for bulk mixing. Impellers are broadly
classified as axialflow or radialflow depending on the direc-
tion of liquid leaving the impeller; some impellers have both
axial- and radial-flow characteristics.
Figure 7.18. Liquid is driven radially from the impeller against
the walls of the tank where it divides into two streams, one
flowing up to the top of the tank and the other flowing down to
the bottom. These streams eventually reach the central axis of
the tank and are drawn back to the impeller. Radial-flow impel-
lers also set up circular flow which must be reduced by baffles.
7.9.2.2 Axial-flow impellers
7.9.2.1
Radial-flow impellers
Radial-flow impellers have blades which are parallel to the ver-
tical axis of the stirrer shaft and tank; the six-flat-blade disc
turbine of Figure 7.15 is an example. The flow pattern set up by
high-speed rotation of a radial-flow impeller is illustrated in
Figure 7.17 (a) Circular flow in an unbaffled stirred tank
viewed from above. (b) Vortex formation during circular flow.
(From J.H. Rushton, E.W. Costich and H.J. Everett, 1950,
Power characteristics of mixing impellers: Part I. Chem. Eng.
Prog. 46, 395-404.)
In general, axial-flow impellers have blades which make an angle
of less than 90 ~ to the plane of rotation and promote axial top-
to-bottom motion. Propellers are axial-flow devices, as are
pitched-blade turbines such as that shown in Figure 7.19. The
flow pattern set up by a typical axial-flow impeller is illustrated
in Figure 7.20. Fluid leaving the impeller is driven downwards
until it is deflected from the floor of the vessel. It then spreads
out over the floor and flows up along the wall before being
drawn back to the impeller. Axial-flow impellers are particularly
useful when strong vertical currents are required. For example, if
the fluid contains solids, a strong axial flow of liquid leaving the
impeller will discourage settling at the bottom of the tank.

As illustrated in Figures 7.18 and 7.20, large liquid-circulation
loops develop in stirred vessels. For mixing to be effective,
fluid circulated by the impeller must sweep the entire vessel in
a reasonable time. In addition, the velocity of fluid leaving the
impeller must be sufficient to carry material into the most
remote parts of the tank. Turbulence must also be developed
in the fluid; mixing is certain to be poor unless flow in the tank
is turbulent. All these factors are important in mixing, which
can be described as a combination of three physical processes:
(i) distribution;
(ii) dispersion; and
(iii) diffusion.
Distribution is sometimes called macromixin~, diffusion is also
called micromixing. Dispersion can be classified as either micro-
or macromixing depending on the scale of fluid motion.
The pattern of bulk fluid flow in a vessel stirred by a radial-
flow impeller is shown in detail in Figure 7.21. Near the
impeller there is a region of high turbulence where fluid cur-
rents converge and exchange material. Away from the impeller,
flow is slower and largely streamline; mixing in these regions is
much less intense than near the impeller. The contents of the
vessel are recirculated through the mixing zone in a very regular
manner due to the periodic pumping action of the impeller.
Let us consider what happens when a small amount of
liquid dye is dropped onto the top of the fluid in Figure 7.21.7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

Figure 7.19
Pitched-blade turbine.
First, the dye is swept by circulating currents down to the
impeller. At the impeller there is vigorous and turbulent
motion of fluid; the dye is mechanically dispersed into smaller
volumes and distributed between the large circulation loops.
These smaller parcels of dye are then carried around the tank,
dispersing all the while into those parts of the system not yet
containing dye. Returning again to the impeller, the dye ali-
quots are broken up into even smaller volumes for further
distribution. After a time, dye is homogeneously distributed
throughout the tank with uniform concentration.
The process whereby dye is transported to all regions of the
vessel by bulk circulation currents is called distribution.
Distribution is an important process in mixing, but can be
relatively slow. In large tanks, the size of the circulation paths
is also large and the time taken to traverse them is long; this,
together with the regularity of fluid pumping at the impeller,
inhibits rapid mixing. Accordingly, distribution is often the
slowest step in the mixing process. If the rotational speed of the
impeller is sufficiently high, superimposed on the distribution7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

Rushton, E.W. Costich and H.J. Everett, 1950, Power characteristics of mixing impellers. Part I. Chem. Eng. Prog. 46, 395-404.)
process is turbulence. Turbulent flow occurs when fluid no
longer travels along streamlines but moves erratically in the
form of cross-currents. The kinetic energy of turbulent fluid is
directed into regions of rotational flow called eddies; masses of
eddies of various size coexist during turbulent flow. Large
eddies are continuously formed by action of the stirrer; these
break down into small eddies which produce even smaller
eddies. Eddies, like spinning tops, possess kinetic energy
which is transferred to eddies of decreasing size. When the
eddies become very small they can no longer sustain rotational
motion and their kinetic energy is dissipated as heat. At steady
state in a mixed tank, most of the energy from the stirrer is dis-
sipated through eddies as heat; energy lost as fluid collides with
the tank walls is generally negligible.
The process of breaking up bulk flow into smaller and
smaller eddies is called dispersion; dispersion facilitates rapid
transfer of material throughout the vessel. The degree of
homogeneity possible as a result of dispersion is limited by the
size of the smallest eddies which may be formed in a particular
fluid. This size is given approximately as the Kolmogorov scale
of mixing, or scale of turbulence, 2~:
(7.14)
where ;t is the characteristic dimension of the smallest eddies,
v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and ~ is the local rate of
turbulent energy dissipation per unit mass of liquid. At steady
state, the rate of energy dissipation by turbulence is equal to
the power supplied by the impeller. According to Eq. (7.14),
the greater the power input to the fluid, the smaller are the
eddies. A, is also dependent on viscosity; at a given power
input, smaller eddies are produced in low-viscosity fluids. For
low-viscosity liquids such as water, ~, is usually in the range
30-100 pm. For such fluids, this is the smallest scale of mixing
achievable by dispersion.
Within eddies there is little mixing because rotational flow
occurs in streamlines. Therefore, to achieve mixing on a scale
smaller than the Kolmogorov scale, we must rely on diffusion.
Molecular diffusion is generally regarded as a slow process;
however, over small distances it can be accomplished quite
rapidly. Within eddies of 30-100 pm diameter, homogeneity
is achieved in about 1 s for low-viscosity fluids. Consequently,7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

Practice, Proc. Syrup. 10, AIChE-IChE Joint Meeting, London, June 1965.)
if power input to a stirred vessel produces eddies of this dimen-
sion, mixing on a molecular scale is accomplished virtually
simultaneously.
7.9.4
Assessing Mixing Effectiveness
As explained in the above section, to achieve rapid mixing in a
stirred tank the agitator must provide good bulk circulation or
macromixing. Micromixing at or near the molecular scale is also
important, but usually occurs relatively quickly compared with
macromixing. Assessment of mixing effectiveness can therefore
be reduced in most cases to measuring the rate of bulk flow.
Mixing time is a useful parameter for assessing mixing effi-
ciency and is applied to characterise bulk flow in fermenters
and reactors. The mixing time tm is the time required to
achieve a given degree of homogeneity starting from the com-
pletely segregated state. It can be measured by injecting a
tracer into the vessel and following its concentration at a fixed
point in the tank. Tracers in common use include acids, bases
and concentrated salt solutions; corresponding detectors are
pH probes and conductivity cells. Mixing time can also be
determined by measuring the temperature response after addi-
tion of a small quantity of heated liquid.
Let us assume that a small pulse of tracer is added to fluid in
a stirred tank already containing tracer material at concentra-
tion C i. When flow in the system is circulatory, the tracer
concentration measured at some fixed point in the tank will
follow a pattern similar to that shown in Figure 7.22. Before
mixing is complete, a relatively high concentration will be
detected every time the bulk flow brings tracer to the measure-
ment point. The peaks in concentration will be separated by a
period approximately equal to the average time taken for fluid
to traverse one bulk circulation loop. In stirred vessels this
period is called the circulation time, tc. After several circula-
tions the desired degree of homogeneity is reached.
Definition of the mixing time tm depends on the degree of
homogeneity required. Usually, mixing time is defined as the
time after which the concentration of tracer differs from the7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

final concentration Cf by less than 10% of the total concentra-
tion difference ( C f - Ci). However, there is no single,
universally-applied definition of mixing time; sometimes devi-
ations greater or less than 10% are specified. Nevertheless, at
tm the tracer concentration is relatively steady and the fluid
composition approaches uniformity. For a single-phase liquid
in a stirred tank with several baf~es and small impeller, there is
an approximate relationship between mixing time and circula-
tion time [26]:
t m = 4 t c.
(7.15)
Industrial-scale stirred vessels with working volumes between
I and 100 m 3 have mixing times between about 30 and 120 s,
depending on conditions.
Intuitively, we can predict that mixing time in stirred tanks
will depend on variables such as the size of the tank and impeller,
fluid properties such as viscosity, and stirrer speed. The relation-
ship between mixing time and several of these variables has been
determined experimentally for different impellers [27]; results
for a Rushton turbine in a baffled tank are shown in Figure 7.23.
The dimensionless product N i t m is plotted as a function of the
impeller Reynolds number Re i defined in Eq. (7.2); t m is the
mixing time based on a 10% deviation from final conditions,
and N i is rotational speed of the stirrer. N i t m represents the
number of stirrer rotations required to homogenise the liquid.
At low Reynolds number, N i t m increases significantly with
decreasing Re i. However, as Reynolds number is increased
above about 5 x 103, N i t m approaches a constant value which
persists at high Re i. For Rushton turbines, this constant value
can be estimated using the following relationship [28]:
N itm =
1.54V
D3
at high Re i
(7.16)
where Vis liquid volume and D i is impeller diameter. Thus,
N i t m at high Reynolds number depends only on the size of the
tank and stirrer. The relationship between N i t m and R e i for
most impellers is similar to that shown in Figure 7.23 for
Rushton turbines. In some systems a slight increase in N i t m
with increasing R e i has been reported; however, in practice we
can assume N i t m reaches a constant value [29]. With N i t m
constant, mixing time reduces in direct proportion to increase
in stirrer speed.
Example 7.1 Estimation of mixing time
A fermentation broth with viscosity 10 -2 Pa s and density 1000 kg m -3 is agitated in a 2.7 m 3 baffled tank using a Rushton
turbine with diameter 0.5 m and stirrer speed I s- 1. Estimate the mixing time.
Solution:
From Eq. (7.2):
Rei=
1 s - 1 ( 0 . 5 m) 2 1000 kgm -3
10-2 k g m - l s - 1

Re i > 5 x 103; therefore N i t m is constant and can be calculated from Eq. (7.16):
Ni tm =
1.54 (2.7 m 3)
(0.5 m) 3
- 33.3.
Therefore:
33.3
tm - l s - 1 - 3 3 . 3 s .
The mixing time is about 33 s.
For rapid and effective mixing, t should be as small as poss-
ible. From Eq. (7.16) we can conclude that, in a tank of fixed
volume, mixing time is reduced if we use a large impeller and
high stirring speed. However, as the power requirements for
mixing are also dependent on impeller diameter and stirrer
speed, it is not always possible to achieve small mixing times
without consuming enormous amounts of energy, especially
in large vessels. Relationships between power requirements,
mixing time, tank size, fluid properties and other operating
variables are explored further in the following section.7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

and II. Chem. Eng. Prog. 46, 395-404, 467-476.)
7.10 Power Requirements for Mixing
Usually, electrical power is used to drive impellers in stirred ves-
sels. For a given stirrer speed, the power required depends on
the resistance offered by the fluid to rotation of the impeller.
Average power consumption per unit volume for industrial
bioreactors ranges from 10 kW m -3 for small vessels (ca.
0.1 m3), to 1-2 k W m -3 for large vessels (ca. 100 m3).
Friction in the stirrer motor gearbox and seals reduces the ener-
gy transmitted to the fluid; therefore, the electrical power
consumed by stirrer motors is always greater than the mixing
power by an amount depending on the efficiency of the drive.
Energy costs for operation of stirrers in bioreactors are an
important consideration in process economics. General guide-
lines for calculating power requirements are discussed below.
7.10.1
Ungassed Newtonian Fluids
Mixing power for non-aerated fluids depends on the stirrer
speed, the impeller diameter and geometry, and properties of7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
IJI
the fluid such as density and viscosity. The relationship
between these variables is usuaily expressed in terms of dimen-
sionless numbers such as the impeller Reynolds number Re i
and the power number Np. Np is defined as:
N p "~"
pN~D~
(7.17)
where P is power, p is fluid density, N i is stirrer speed and D i is
impeller diameter. The relationship between Re i and Np has
been determined experimentally for a range of impeller and tank
configurations. The results for five impeller designs: Rushton
turbine, paddle, marine propeller, anchor and helical ribbon, are
shown in Figures 7.24 and 7.25 [29-31 ]. Once the value o f N v is
known, the power required is calculated from Eq. (7.17) as:
P = Np p N3i D i5.
(7.18)
For a given impeller, the general relationship between power
number and Reynolds number depends on the flow regime in
the tank. Three flow regimes can be identified in Figures 7.24
and 7.25:
(i)
Laminar regime. The laminar regime corresponds to
Rei < 10 for many impellers; for stirrers with very small
wall-clearance such as the anchor and helical-ribbon
mixer, laminar flow persists until Re i - 1O0 or greater. In
the laminar regime:
N v o~
1
&
or
P= k 1~ N ~ D3i
(7.19)
where k1 is a proportionality constant. Values of k 1 for
the impellers illustrated in Figures 7.24 and 7.25 are list-
ed in Table 7.3 [29]. Power required for laminar flow is
independent of the density of the fluid but directly pro-
portional to fluid viscosity.
(ii) Turbulent regime. Power number is independent of
Reynolds number in turbulent flow. Therefore:
power to the fluid than other designs. Power required for
turbulent flow is independent of the viscosity of the fluid
but proportional to fluid density. The turbulent regime is
fully developed at Re i > 103 or 104 for most small impel-
lers in baffled vessels. For the same impellers in vessels
without baffles, the power curves are somewhat different
from those shown in Figure 7.24. Without baffles, turbu-
lence is no t fully developed until R e i > 105; even then the
value of NI~ is reduced to between 1/2 and 1/10 that with
baffles [29-31].
(iii) Transition regime. Between laminar and turbulent flow
lies the transition regime. Both density and viscosity
affect power requirements in this regime. There is usually
a gradual transition from laminar to fully-developed tur-
bulent flow in stirred tanks; the flow pattern and
Reynolds-number range for transition depend on system
geometry.
Eqs (7.19) and (7.20) express the strong dependence of power
consumption on stirrer diameter and, to a lesser extent, stirrer
speed. Small changes in impeller size have a large effect on
power requirements, as would be expected from dependency
on impeller diameter raised to the third or fifth power. In the
turbulent regime, a 10% increase in impeller diameter
increases the power required by more than 60%; a 10%
increase in stirrer speed raises the power required by over 30%.
Frictional drag, and therefore the power required for stir-
ring, depend on the geometry of the impeller and
configuration of the tank. The curves of Figures 7.24 and 7.25
refer to the particular geometries specified and will change if
the number or size of baffles, the number, length, width, pitch
or angle of blades on the impeller, the height of impeller from
the bottom of the tank, etc. are changed. For a Rushton tur-
bine in a baffled tank under fully turbulent conditions
(Re i > 104), the power number lies between about 2 and 10
depending on these parameters [25, 3.t]. For propellers,
impeller pitch has a significant effect on power number in the
turbulent regime [25].

From Figure 7.24, flow at this Re i is fully turbulent. From Table 7.3, NI~ is 0.35; therefore:

7.10.2 Ungassed Non-Newtonian Fluids
Estimation of power requirements for non-Newtonian fluids
is more difficulc It may be impossible with highly viscous
fluid~ to achieve fully-developed turbulence so that Np is
always dependent on Re i. In addition, because the viscosity of
non-Newtonian liquids varies with shear conditions, the
impeller Reynolds number used to correlate power require-
ments must be re-defined. Some power correlations have been
devdoped using an impeller Reynolds number based on the
apparent viscosity pea:

where k is a constant with magnitude dependent on the geom-
etry of the impeller. The relationship of Eq. (7.11) is discussed

Substituting Eq. (7.11) into Eq. (7.22) gives an appropriate
Reynolds number for pseudoplastic fluids:
N2-,,D2p
Re i =

(7.23)
The relationship between power number and Reynolds num-
ber for a Rushton turbine in a baffled tank containing
pseudoplastic non-Newtonian fluid is shown in Figure 7.26
[32, 35]. The upper line was measured using Newtonian fluid
for which R e i is defined by Eq. (7.2); this line corresponds to
part of the curve already shown in Figure 7.24. The lower line
gives the N p - R e i relationship for pseudoplastic fluid with R e i
103
defined by Eq. (7.23). The laminar region extends to higher
Reynolds numbers in pseudoplastic fluids than in Newtonian
systems. At Re i below 10 and above 200 the results for
Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are essentially the
same; in the intermediate range, pseudoplastic liquids con-
sume less power than Newtonian fluids.
There are several practical difficulties with application of
Figure 7.26 for design of bioreactors. As discussed further in
Section 7.13, flow patterns in pseudoplastic and Newtonian
fluids differ significantly. Even when there is high turbulence
near the impeller in pseudoplastic systems, the bulk liquid may
be moving very slowly and consuming relatively little power.
Another problem is that, as illustrated in Figure 7.10, the non-
Newtonian parameters K and n, and therefore pea, c a n vary
substantially during fermentation.
7.10.3 Gassed Fluids
Liquids into which gas is sparged have reduced power require-
ments. Gas bubbles decrease the density of the fluid; however,
the influence of density on power requirements as expressed by
Eq. (7.20) does not adequately explain all the power character-
istics of gas-liquid systems. The presence of bubbles also7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
x54
affects the hydrodynamic behaviour of fluid around the impel-
ler. Large gas-filled cavities develop behind the stirrer blades in
aerated liquids; these cavities reduce the resistance to fluid flow
and decrease the drag coefficient of the impeller. Typical gas
cavities are shown in Figure 7.27; this photograph taken
through the base of a baffled tank shows a nine-blade disc-
turbine with sparger positioned just below the impeller [33].
All of the changes in hydrodynamic behaviour due to gassing
are not completely understood. Power consumption is strongly
controlled by gas-cavity formation; because this process is dis-
continuous and appears somewhat random, reduction in power
consumption is typically non-uniform. The random nature of
gas dispersion in agitated tanks means that it is difficult to obtain
an accurate prediction of power requirements. However, an
expression for the ratio ofgassed to ungassed power as a function
of operating conditions has been obtained [34]:

is about 12%. With sparging, the power consumed could be
reduced to as little as half the ungassed value, depending on gas
flow rate [33].
7.11 Scale-Up of Mixing Systems
Design of industrial-scale bioprocesses is usually based on the
performance of small-scale prototypes. Determining optim-
um operating conditions at production scale is expensive and
time-consuming; accordingly, it is always better to know
whether a particular process will work properly before it is
constructed in full size. Ideally, scale-up should be carried out
so that conditions in the large vessel are as close as possible to
those producing good results in the small vessel. As mixing is
an important function of bioreactors, it would seem desirable
to keep the mixing time constant on scale-up. Unfortunately,
as explained below, the relationship between mixing time and
power consumption makes this rarely possible in practice.
As the volume of mixing vessels is increased, so too are the
lengths of the flow paths for bulk circulation. To keep the mix-
ing time constant, the velocity of fluid in the tank must be
increased in proportion to the size. As a rough guide, under
turbulent conditions the power per unit volume is propor-
tional to the fluid velocity squared:
P/V ~ v2
(7.25)
where P is power, V is liquid volume, and v is fluid linear
velocity. The effect of this relationship on power requirements
is illustrated in the following example. Suppose a cylindrical
1 m 3 pilot-scale stirred tank is scaled up to 100 m 3. If the tanks
are geometrically similar, the length of the flow path in the
large tank is about 4.5 times that in the small tank. Therefore,
to keep the same mixing time, fluid velocity in the large tank
must be approximately 4.5 times faster. From Eq. (7.25) this
would entail a (4.5) 2 or 20-fold increase in power per unit vol-
ume. So, if the power input to the 1 m 3 pilot-scale vessel is P,
the power required for the same mixing time in the 100 m 3
tank is about 2000P. This represents an extremely large
increase in power, much greater than is economically or tech-
nically feasible with most equipment used for stirring. Because
the criterion of constant mixing time can hardly ever be
applied for scale-up, it is inevitable that mixing times increase
with scale. If instead of mixing time, P/V is kept constant dur-
ing scale-up, mixing time can be expected to increase in
proportion to vessel diameter raised to the power 0.67 [29].
Reduced productivity and performance often accompany
scale-up ofbioreactors as a result of lower mixing efficiency and
subsequent alteration of the physical environment. One way of
improving the design procedure is to use scale-downmethoeh.7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
IJ'j
The general idea behind scale-down is that small-scale experi-
ments to determine operating parameters are carried out under
conditions that can actually be realised, physically and econom-
ically, at production scale. For example, if we decide that power
input to a large-scale vessel cannot exceed a certain limit, we can
calculate the corresponding mixing time and use an appropriate
power input to a small-scale reactor to simulate mixing condi-
tions in the large-scale system. Using this approach, as long as
the flow regime is the same in the small- and large-scale ferment-
ers, there is a better chance that results achieved in the
small-scale unit will be reproducible in the larger system.
Figure 7.28
Multiple impellers in a tall fermenter.
7.12 Improving Mixing in Fermenters
Sometimes, for the reasons outlined in the previous section, it
is not possible to reduce mixing times by simply raising the
power input to the stirrer. So, while increasing the stirrer speed
is an obvious way of improving fluid circulation, other tech-
niques may be required.
Mixing can sometimes be improved by changing the configu-
ration of the system. Baffles should be installed; this is routine for
stirred fermenters and produces greater turbulence. For efficient
mixing the impeller should be mounted below the geometric
centre of the vessel. In standard designs the impeller is located
about one impeller diameter, or one-third the tank diameter,
above the bottom of the tank. Mixing is facilitated when circula-
tion currents below the impeller are smaller than those above;
fluid particles leaving the impeller at the same instant then take
different periods of time to return and exchange material. Rate
of distribution throughout the vessel is increased when upper
and lower circulation loops are asynchronous.
Another device for improving mixing is multiple impellers,
although this requires an increase in power input. Typical bio-
reactors used for aerobic culture are tall cylindrical vessels with
liquid depths significantly greater than the tank diameter. This
design produces a higher hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of
the vessel, and gives rising air bubbles a longer contact time
with the liquid. Effective mixing in tall fermenters requires
more than one impeller, as illustrated in Figure 7.28. Each
impeller generates its own circulation currents. The distance
between impellers should be 1.0 to 1.5 impeller diameters. If
the impellers are spaced too far apart, unagitated zones develop
between them; conversely, impellers located too close together
produce flow streams which interfere with each other and dis-
rupt circulation to the far reaches of the vessel. In ungassed
systems with spacing between impellers of at least one impeller
diameter, the power dissipated by multiple impellers is
approximated by the following relationship:
(P)n= n(P)l
(7.26)
where (P) n is the power required by n impellers and (P) 1 is the
power required by a single impeller. Two turbines spaced less
than one impeller diameter apart can draw as much as 2.4 times
the power of a single turbine. When the vessel is sparged with
gas the power relationship may not be so simple. As described
in Section 7.10.3, the presence of gas bubbles reduces the
power required for the lowest impeller. However the quantity
of gas passing through the upper impellers is often muchlJ6
7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
smaller; when this occurs the power drawn by each additional
impeller is large compared with a single-impeller system [36].
Additional mixing problems can occur in fermenters when
material is fed into the system during operation. If bulk distri-
bution is slow, fermenters operated continuously or in
fed-batch mode develop high localised concentrations of sub-
strate near the feed point. This has been observed particularly
in large-scale processes for production of single-cell-protein
from methanol. Because high levels of methanol are toxic to
cells, biomass yields decrease significantly when mixing of feed
material into the broth is slow. Problems like this can be allevi-
ated by using multiple injection points to aid distribution of
substrate. It is much less expensive to do this than to increase
the fluid velocity and power input.
7.13 Effect of Rheological Properties on Mixing
For effective mixing there must be turbulent conditions in the
mixing vessel. Intensity of turbulence is represented by the
impeller Reynolds number Re i. As shown in Figure 7.23 for a
baffled tank with turbine impeller, once Re i falls below about
5 • 103 turbulence is damped and mixing time increases signi-
ficantly. Re i as defined in Eq. (7.2) decreases in direct pro-
portion to increase in viscosity. Accordingly, non-turbulent
conditions and poor mixing are likely to occur during
agitation of highly viscous fluids. Increasing the impeller speed
is an obvious solution but, as discussed in Section 7.11, this
requires considerable increase in power consumption and
therefore may not be feasible.
Most non-Newtonian fluids in bioprocessing are pseudo-
plastic. Because the apparent viscosity of these fluids depends
on the shear rate, the rheological behaviour of many culture
broths depends on shear conditions in the fermenter. Metzner
and Otto [32] have proposed that the average shear rate in a
stirred vessel is a linear function of stirrer speed:
~av= kNi
vessels, pseudoplastic fluids have relatively low apparent viscos-
ity in the high-shear zone near the impeller, and relatively high
apparent viscosity when the fluid is away from the impeller. As a
result, flow patterns similar to that illustrated in Figure 7.30 can
develop; a small circulating pool of highly sheared fluid sur-
rounds the impeller while the bulk liquid scarcely moves at all.
In bioreactors containing non-Newtonian broths, this can lead
to development of stagnant zones away from the impeller.
The effects of local fluid thinning in pseudoplastic fluids can
be countered by modifying the geometry of the system or impel-
ler design. Stirrers of larger diameter are recommended. For
turbine impellers, instead of the conventional tank-to-impeller
diameter ratio of 3:1 used with low viscosity fluids, this ratio is
reduced to between 1.6 and 2. Different impeller designs which
sweep the entire volume of the vessel are also recommended.
The most common types used for viscous mixing are helical
impellers and gate- and paddle-anchors mounted with small
clearance between the impeller and tank wall. Mixing with these
stirrers is accomplished at low speed without high-velocity
streams. Helical agitators have been used to reduce shear dam-
age and improve mixing in viscous cell suspensions [38].
Alternative impeller designs such as the helical ribbon and
anchor improve mixing in viscous fluids; however their appli-
cation in fermenters is only possible when oxygen demand in
the culture is relatively low. Although large-diameter impellers
operating at relatively slow speed give superior bulk mixing,
high-shear systems with small, high-speed impellers are prefer-
able for breaking up gas bubbles and promoting oxygen
transfer to the liquid. In design of fermenters for viscous cul-
tures, a compromise is usually required between mixing
effectiveness and adequate mass transfer.
7.14 Role of Shear in Stirred Fermenters
Mixing in bioreactors must provide the shear conditions neces-
sary to disperse bubbles, droplets and cell flocs. Dispersion of

where ~ a v is the average shear rate, k is a constant dependent
on impeller design and N i is stirrer speed. Experimental values
of k are summarised in Table 7.4. The validity of Eq. (7.27)
was established in studies by Metzner et al. [35]. However,
shear rate in stirred vessels is far from uniform, being strongly
dependent on distance from the impeller. Figure 7.29 indi-
cates the rapid decline in shear rate in pseudoplastic fluid with
increasing radial distance from the tip of a flat-blade turbine
impeller [37]. The maximum shear rate close to the impeller is
much higher than the average calculated from Eq. (7.27).
Pseudoplastic fluids are shear thinning, i.e. their apparent
viscosity decreases with increasing shear. Accordingly, in stirred

gas bubbles by agitation involves a balance between opposing
forces. Shear forces in turbulent eddies stretch and distort the
bubbles and break them into smaller sizes; at the same time,
surface tension at the gas-liquid interface tends to restore the
bubbles to their spherical shape. In the case of solid material
such as cell flocs or aggregates, shear forces in turbulent flow are
resisted by the mechanical strength of the particles.
While bubble break-up is required in fermenters to facili-
tate oxygen transfer, disruption of cells is undesirable.
Different cell types display different levels of shear sensitivity;
insect, mammalian and plant cells are known to be particularly
sensitive to mechanical forces. Bioreactors used for culture of
these cells must limit the intensity of shear while still providing
adequate mixing and mass transfer. At the present time, the
effects of shear on cells are not well understood. Cell disrup-
tion is an obvious outcome of high shear forces; however more
subtle changes such as retardation of growth and product syn-
thesis, denaturation of extracellular proteins, change in
morphology, and thickening of the cell wall, may also occur.
Because there is significant spatial variation in shear inten-
sity in stirred vessels, the precise shear conditions experienced
by cells are poorly defined. There have been many publications
in recent years addressing the problem of shear damage,
especially in insect- and mammalian-cell cultures. Several
mechanisms have been considered in terms of their contribu-
tion to cell damage:
(i) interaction between cells and turbulent eddies;
(ii) collisions between cells, collision of cells with the impel-
ler, and collision of cells with stationary surfaces in the
vessel;
(iii) generation of shear forces in the boundary layers and
wakes near solid objects in the reactor, especially the
impeller;
(iv) generation of shear forces as bubbles rise through liquid;
and
(v) bursting of bubbles at the liquid surface.
Detailed discussion of these effects can be found elsewhere
[39-50]. In general, when gas bubbles are not present in the
liquid, interactions between cells and turbulent eddies are con-
sidered most likely to damage cells. However, if the vessel is
sparged with air, shear damage can occur at much lower impel-
ler speeds due to shear effects associated with bubbles [44].
7.14.1 Interaction Between Cells and
Turbulent Eddies
LC5
Hydrodynamic effects have been studied mainly with animal
cells because shear damage is a significant problem in large-scale
culture. Many animal cells used in bioprocessing are anchorage-
dependent; this means that the cells must be attached to a solid7 Fluid Flow and Mixing

surface for survival. In bioreactors, the surface area required for
cell attachment is provided very effectively by microcarrier beads,
which range in diameter from 80 to 200 lim. As shown in
Figure 7.31, cells cover the surface of the beads which are then
suspended in nutrient medium. There are many benefits associ-
ated with use of microcarriers; however, a disadvantage is that
cells attached to microcarriers cannot easily change position or
rotate in response to shear forces in the fluid. This, coupled with
the lack of a protective cell wall, make animal cells on microcar-
riers especially susceptible to shear damage.
Interactions between microcarriers and eddies in turbulent
flow have the potential to cause mechanical damage to cells.
Example 7.3
Operating
conditions
for turbulent
The intensity of shear associated with these interactions is
dependent on the relative sizes of the eddies and microcarrier
particles. If the particles are small relative to the eddies, they
tend to be captured or entrained in the eddies as shown in
Figure 7.32(a). As fluid motion within eddies is laminar, if the
density of the microcarriers is about the same as the suspend-
ing fluid, there is little relative motion of the particles.
Accordingly, the velocity difference between the fluid stream-
lines and the microcarriers is small, except for brief periods of
acceleration when the bead enters a new eddy. On average,
therefore, if the particles are smaller than the eddies, the shear
effects of eddy-cell interactions are minimal.
If the stirrer speed is increased and the average eddy size
reduced, interactions between eddies and microcarriers can
occur in two possible ways. A single eddy that cannot fully
engulf the particle will act on part of its surface and cause the
particle to rotate in the fluid; this will result in a relatively low
level of shear at the surface of the bead. However, much higher
shear stresses result when several eddies with opposing rota-
tion interact with the particle simultaneously, as illustrated in
Figure 7.32(b). It has been found experimentally that detri-
mental effects start to occur when the Kolmogorov scale (Eq.
7.14) for eddy size drops below 2/3-1/2 the diameter of the
microcarrier beads [41, 42, 49]. Excessive agitation leads to
formation of eddies with size small enough and of sufficient
energy to cause damage to the cells. These findings for cells on
microcarriers apply also to freely suspended cells; however,
because cells are smaller than microcarriers, eddy sizes causing
shear damage are also smaller.
shear damage
Microcarrier beads 120 lain in diameter are used to culture recombinant C H O cells for production of growth hormone. It is
proposed to use a 6-cm turbine impeller to mix the culture in a 3.5-1itre stirred tank. Air and carbon dioxide are supplied by flow
through the reactor headspace. The microcarrier suspension has a density of approximately 1010 kg m -3 and a viscosity of
1.3 x 10 -3 Pa s. Estimate the maximum allowable stirrer speed which avoids turbulent shear damage of the cells.
Solution:
Damage due to eddies is avoided if the K61mogorov scale remains greater than 2/3--1/2 the diameter of the beads. Let us deter-
mine the stirrer speed required to create eddies with size ,~ = 2/3 (120 lam) = 80 }am = 8 x 10 -5 rn. The stirrer power producing
eddies of this dimension can be estimated using Eq. (7.14) and the properties of the fluid.

= 0.052m 2s -3.
e represents the power dissipated per unit mass of fluid. The mass of fluid in which turbulent power is dissipated may be taken as
the entire contents of the tank; however power dissipation occurs unevenly throughout the vessel with highest levels in the vicin-
ity of the impeller, e based on the mass of fluid near the impeller is considered the more appropriate value in these calculations
[50]; fluid mass in the impeller zone is roughly equal to p Di3 where p is fluid density and O i is impeller diameter. Therefore, the
stirrer power Pis equal to e multiplied by p D 3.

P = 1.13• 10-2kgm2s -3 = 1.13x 10-2W.
From Figure 7.24 and Table 7.3, N~, is about 5 for a turbine impeller operating in the turbulent regime, depending on tank
geometry. The stirrer speed corresponding to these conditions can be calculated from Eq. (7.20):

Taking the cube root:
N i = 1.42 s- 1 = 8 5 . 5 rpm.
Flow is just turbulent with Re i - 4 x 103. This analysis indicates that shear damage from turbulent eddies is not expected until
the stirrer speed exceeds about 85 rpm. If the culture were sparged with gas, it is possible that shear damage would occur due to
other mechanisms, e.g. bursting bubbles.I6O
7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
As indicated by Eq. (7.14), if the viscosity of the fluid is
increased, the size of the smallest eddies also increases.
Increasing the fluid viscosity should, therefore, reduce shear
damage in bioreactors. This effect has been demonstrated by
addition of thickening agents to animal-cell growth medium;
moderate increases in viscosity have been shown to signifi-
cantly reduce turbulent cell death [42].
7.14.2 Bubble Shear
When liquid containing shear-sensitive cells is sparged with
air, other damaging mechanisms come into play. From experi-
ments conducted so far, these appear to be associated primarily
with bubbles bursting at the surface of the liquid. Breakage of
the thin bubble film and rapid flow from the bubble rim back
into the liquid generate high shear forces capable of damaging
certain types of cell. Further discussion of these effects can be
found in the literature [43-47].

Impeller viscometer
7.3
The rheology of a Penicillium chrysogenumbroth is examined
using an impeller viscometer. The density of the cell suspen-
sion is approximately 1000 kg m -3. Samples of broth are
poured into a glass beaker of diameter 15 cm and stirred slow-
ly using a Rushton turbine of diameter 4 cm. The average
shear rate generated by this impeller is greater than the stirrer
speed by a factor of about 10.2. When the stirrer shaft is
attached to a device for measuring torque and rotational speed,
the following results are recorded.

If so, evaluate Kand n.
(b) Viscosity measurements using impeller viscometers must
be carried out under laminar flow conditions. Check that
flow in this experiment is laminar.
(c) Use of turbines for impeller viscometry restricts the range
of shear rates that can be tested. How is the situation
improved with a helical-ribbon impeller?

Cells in fermenters must be kept from settling out of suspen-
sion. The minimum stirrer speed required to keep the bottom
of the tank free of cells can be estimated roughly using a rela-

A certain minimum stirrer speed is also required in aerobic
systems for proper dispersion of air bubbles. From the data of
Westerterp et al. [52], the minimum stirrer tip speed (tip speed
= ~: N i Di) for this purpose can be assumed to lie between 1.5
and 2.5 m s-1, depending on the surface tension between the
gas and liquid, the fluid density, and the tank-to-impeller
diameter ratio.
A fermentation broth contains 40 wt% cells of average
dimension 10 tam and density 1.04 g cm -3. The diameter of
the impeller in the fermenter is 30 cm. Assuming that the den-
sity and viscosity of the suspending medium are the same as
water, determine which takes more power to achieve, cell sus-
pension or bubble dispersion.
7.5
Scale-up of mixing system
To ensure turbulent conditions and minimum mixing time
during agitation with a turbine impeller, the Reynolds num-
ber must be at least 104.
(a) A stirred laboratory-scale fermenter with a turbine impel-
ler 5 cm in diameter is operated at 800 rpm. If the density
of broth being stirred is close to that of water, what is the
upper limit for viscosity of the suspension if adequate mix-
ing is to be maintained?
(b) The mixing system is scaled up so the tank and impeller are
15 times the diameter of the laboratory equipment. The
stirrer in the large vessel is operated so that the stirrer tip
speed (tip speed = ~; N i D i) is the same as in the laboratory
apparatus. How does scale-up affect the maximum viscosity
allowable for maintenance of turbulent mixing conditions?
7.6
Effect of viscosity on power requirements
A cylindrical bioreactor of diameter 3 m has four baffles. A
Rushton turbine mounted in the reactor has a diameter one-
third the tank diameter and is operated at a speed of 90 rpm.
The density of the fluid is approximately I g cm -3. The reac-
tor is used to culture an anaerobic organism that does not
require gas sparging. The broth can be assumed Newtonian.
As the cells grow, the viscosity of the broth increases.
(a) Compare power requirements when the viscosity is:
(i) approximately that of water;
(ii) 100 times greater than water; and
(iii) 104 times greater than water.
(b) When the viscosity is 1000 times greater than water, esti-
mate the power required to achieve turbulence.

E l e c t r i c a l p o w e r required for m i x i n g
Laboratory-scale fermenters are usually mixed using small stir-
rers with electric motors rated between 100 and 500 W. One7 Fluid Flow and Mixing
such motor is used to drive a 7-cm turbine impeller in a small
reactor containing fluid with the properties of water. The stir-
rer speed is 900 rpm. Estimate the power requirements for this
process. How do you explain the difference between the
amount of electrical power consumed by the motor and the
power dissipated by the stirrer?

A cylindrical stirred bioreactor of diameter and height 2 m has
a Rushton turbine one-third the tank diameter in size. The
bioreactor contains Newtonian culture broth with the same

1.5 kW m -3, determine the maximum allowable stirrer
speed. What is the mixing time under these conditions?

Heat Transfer
In this chapter we are concerned with theprocess of heat flow between hot and cold systems. The rate at which heat is
transferred depends directly on two variables: the temperature difference between the hot and cold bodies, and the surface
area available for heat exchange. It is also influenced by many other factors, such as the geometry andphysicalproperties of the
system and, iffluid is present, the flow conditions. Fluids are often heated or cooled in bioprocessing. Typical examples are
removal of heat during fermenter operation using cooling water, and heating of raw medium to sterilisation temperature by
steam.
As shown in Chapters 5 and 6, energy balances allow us to
determine the heating and cooling requirements of fermenters
and enzyme reactors. Once the rate of heat transfer for a par-
ticular purpose is known, the surface area required to achieve
this rate can be calculated using design equations. Estimating
the heat-transfer surface area is a central objective in design as
this parameter determines the size of heat-exchange equip-
ment. In this chapter the principles governing heat transfer are
outlined with applications in bioprocess design.
First, let us look at the types of equipment used for indus-
trial heat-exchange.
8.1 Heat-Transfer Equipment
In bioprocessing, heat exchange occurs most frequently
between fluids. Equipment is provided to allow transfer of
heat while preventing the fluids from actually coming into
contact with each other. In most heat exchangers, heat is trans-
ferred through a solid metal wall which separates the fluid
streams. Sufficient surface area is provided so that the desired
rate of heat transfer can be achieved. Heat transfer is facilitated
by agitation and turbulent flow of the fluids.
8.1.1
Bioreactors
Two applications of heat transfer are common in bioreactor
operation. The first is in situ batch sterilisation of liquid
medium. In this process, the fermenter vessel containing
medium is heated using steam and held at the sterilisation
temperature for a period of time; cooling water is then used to
bring the temperature back to normal operating conditions.
Sterilisation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 13. The
other application of heat transfer is for temperature control
during reactor operation. Metabolic activity of cells generates
a substantial amount of heat in fermenters; this heat must be
removed to avoid temperature increases. Most fermentations
take place in the range 30-37~
in large-scale operations,
cooling water is used to maintain the temperature usually to
within I~
Small-scale fermenters have different heat-
exchange requirements; because the external surface area to
volume ratio is much greater and heat losses through the wall
of the vessel more significant, laboratory-scale units often
require heating rather than cooling. Many enzyme reactions
also require heating to maintain optimum temperature.
Equipment used for heat exchange in bioreactors usually
takes one of the forms illustrated in Figure 8.1. The fermenter
may have an external jacket (Figure 8. la) or coil (Figure 8. lb)
through which steam or cooling water is circulated.
Alternatively, helical (Figure 8. lc) or baffle (Figure 8. ld) coils
may be located internally. Another method is to pump liquid
from the reactor through a separate heat-exchange unit as
shown in Figure 8. l(e).
The surface area available for heat transfer is lower in the
external jacket and coil designs of Figures 8. l(a) and (b) than
when internal coils are completely submerged in the reactor
contents. External jackets on bioreactors provide sufficient
heat-transfer area for laboratory and other small-scale systems;
however they are likely to be inadequate for large-scale fermen-
tations. Internal coils are frequently used in production
vessels; the coil can be operated with high liquid velocity and
the entire tube surface is exposed to the reactor contents pro-
viding a relatively large heat-transfer area. There are some
disadvantages with internal structures: they interfere with
mixing in the vessel and make cleaning of the reactor difficult;I6J

another problem is film growth of cells on the heat-transfer
surface. In contrast, the external heat exchange unit shown in
Figure 8. l(e) is independent of the reactor, easy to scale-up,
and can provide better heat-transfer capabilities than any of
the other configurations. However, conditions of sterility
must be met, the cells must be able to withstand the shear
forces imposed during pumping, and, in aerobic fermenta-
tions, the residence time in the heat exchanger must be small
enough to ensure the medium does not become depleted of
oxygen.
When internal coils such as those in Figures 8.1 (c) and (d)
are used to carry cooling water for removal of heat from a fer-
menter, the variation of water temperature with distance
through the coil is as shown in Figure 8.2. The temperature of
the cooling water rises as it flows through the tube and takes up
heat from the fermenter contents. The water temperature
increases steadily from its inlet temperature Li to the outlet
temperature Tco. On the other hand, if the fermenter contents
are well mixed, temperature gradients in the bulk fluid are neg-
ligible and the temperature is uniform at TF.

8.1.2 General Equipment For Heat Transfer
Many types of general-purpose equipment are used indus-
trially for heat-exchange operations. The simplest form of8 Heat Transfer
heat-transfer equipment is the double-pipe heat exchanger; for
larger capacities, more elaborate shell-and-tube units contain-
ing hundreds of square metres of heat-exchange area are
required. These devices are described below.
8.1.2.1 Double-pipe heat exchanger
A double-pipe heat exchanger consists of two metal pipes, one
inside the other as shown in Figure 8.3. One fluid flows
through the inner tube while the other fluid flows in the annu-
lar space between the pipe walls. When one of the fluids is
hotter than the other, heat flows from it through the wall of
the inner tube into the other fluid. As a result, the hot fluid
becomes cooler and the cold fluid becomes warmer.
Double-pipe heat exchangers can be operated with counter-
current or cocurrent flow of fluid. If, as indicated in Figure 8.3,
the two fluids enter at opposite ends of the device and pass in
Figure 8.3
166
opposite directions through the pipes, the flow is countercur-
rent. Cold fluid entering the device meets the hot fluid just as it
is leaving, i.e. cold fluid at its lowest temperature is placed in
thermal contact with hot fluid also at its lowest temperature.
Changes in temperature of the two fluids as they flow counter-
currently through the length of the pipe are shown in Figure
8.4. The four terminal temperatures are as follows: Thi is the
inlet temperature of the hot fluid, Tho is the outlet temperature
of the hot fluid, Li is the inlet temperature of the cold fluid,
and Tco is the outlet temperature of the cold fluid leaving the
system. A sign of efficient operation is Tco close to Thi, or Tho
close to Li"
The alternative to countercurrent flow is cocurrent or paral-
/el flow. In this mode of operation, both fluids enter their
respective tubes at the same end of the exchanger and flow in
the same direction to the other end. The temperature curves
for cocurrent flow are given in Figure 8.5. Cocurrent operation

is not as effective as countercurrent; it is not possible using
cocurrent flow to bring the exit temperature of one fluid close
to the entrance temperature of the other. Instead, the exit tem-
peratures of both streams lie between the two entrance
temperatures. Less heat can be transferred in parallel flow than
in countercurrent flow; consequently, parallel flow is applied
less frequently.
Double-pipe heat exchangers can be extended to several
passes arranged in a vertical stack, as illustrated in Figure 8.3.
However, when large surface areas are needed to achieve the
desired rate of heat transfer, the weight of the outer pipe
becomes so great that an alternative design, the shell-and-tube

heat exchanger, is a better and more economical choice. As a
rule of thumb, if the heat-transfer area between the fluids must
be more than 10-15 m 2, a shell-and-tube exchanger is
required.
8.1.2.2 Shell-and-tube heat exchangers
Shell-and-tube heat exchangersare used for heating and cooling
all types of fluid. They have the advantage of containing very
large surface areas in a relatively small volume. The simplest
form, called a single-pass shell-and-tube heat exchanger, is
shown in Figure 8.6.
Figure 8.6 Single-pass shell-and-tube heat exchanger. (From A.S. Foust, L.A. Wenzel, C.W. Clump, L. Maus and L.B.
Andersen, 1960, Principles of Unit Operations,John Wiley, New York.)8 Heat Transfer
Consider the device of Figure 8.6 for exchange of sensible
heat from one fluid to another. The heat-transfer system is
divided into two sections: a tube bundle containing pipes
through which one fluid flows, and a shell or cavity where the
other fluid flows. Hot or cold fluid may be put into either the
tubes or the shell. In a single-pass exchanger, the shell and tube
fluids pass down the length of the equipment only once. The
fluid which is to travel in the tubes enters at the inlet header.
The header is divided from the rest of the apparatus by a tube
sheet. Open tubes are fitted into the tube sheet; fluid in the
header cannot enter the main cavity of the exchanger but must
pass into the tubes. The tube-side fluid leaves the exchanger
through another header at the outlet. Shell-side fluid enters
the internal cavity of the exchanger and flows around the out-
sides of the tubes in a direction which is largely countercurrent
to the tube fluid. Heat is exchanged across the tube walls from
hot fluid to cold fluid. As shown in Figure 8.6, bafflesare often
installed in the shell to decrease the cross-sectional area
for flow and divert the shell fluid so it flows mainly across
rather than parallel to the tubes. Both these effects promote
turbulence in the shell fluid which improves the rate of heat
transfer. As well as directing the flow of shell fluid, baffles also

support the tube bundle and keep the tubes from sagging.
The length of tubes in a single-pass heat exchanger deter-
mines the surface area available for heat transfer, and therefore
the rate at which heat can be exchanged. However, there are
practical and economic limits to the maximum length of
single-pass tubes; if greater heat-transfer capacity is required
multiple-pass heat exchangers are employed. Heat exchangers
containing more that one tube pass are used routinely; Figure
8.7 shows the structure of a heat exchanger with one shell pass
and a double tube pass. In this device, the header for the tube
fluid is divided into two sections. Fluid entering the header is
channelled into the lower half of the tubes and flows to the
other end of the exchanger. The header at the other end diverts
the fluid into the upper tubes; the tube-side fluid therefore
leaves the exchanger at the same end it entered. On the shell
side, the configuration is the same as for the single-pass struc-
ture of Figure 8.6; fluid enters one end of the shell and flows
around several baffles to the other end.
In a double-tube pass exchanger, flow of tube and shell
fluids is mainly countercurrent for one tube pass and mainly
cocurrent for the other; however, because of the action of the
baffles, cross-flow of shell-side fluid normal to the tubes also8 Heat Transfer
I69
occurs. Temperature curves for the exchanger depend on the
location of the shell-side entry nozzle; this is illustrated in
Figure 8.8 for hot fluid flowing in the shell. In the temperature
profile of Figure 8.8(b), a temperature cross occurs where, at
some point in the exchanger, the temperature of the cold fluid
equals the temperature of the hot fluid. This situation should
be avoided because, after the cross, the cold fluid is actually
cooled rather than heated. The solution is an increased num-
ber of shell passes or, more practically, provision of another
heat exchanger in series with the first.
Heat exchangers with multiple shell-passes can also be
used. However, in comparison with multiple-tube pass equip-
ment, multiple-shell exchangers are complex in construction
and are normally applied only in very large installations.
8.2 Mechanisms o f Heat Transfer
Heat transfer occurs by one or more of the following three
mechanisms.
Conduction. Heat conduction occurs by transfer of vibra-
tional energy between molecules, or movement of free
electrons. Conduction is particularly important with met-
als and occurs without observable movement of matter.
(ii) Convection. Convection requires movement on a macro-
scopic scale; it is therefore confined to gases and liquids.
Natural convection occurs when temperature gradients in
the system generate localised density differences which
result in flow currents. In forced convection, flow currents
are set in motion by an external agent such as a stirrer or
pump and are independent of density gradients. Higher
rates of heat transfer are possible with forced convection
compared with natural convection.
(iii) Radiation. Energy is radiated from all materials in the
form of waves; when this radiation is absorbed by matter
it appears as heat. Because radiation is important at much
higher temperatures than those normally encountered in
biological processing, it will not be mentioned further.

8.3 Conduction
In most heat-transfer equipment, heat is exchanged between
fluids separated by a solid wall. Heat transfer through the wall
occurs by conduction. In this section we consider equations
describing rate of conduction as a function of operating
variables.
Conduction of heat through a homogeneous solid wall is
depicted in Figure 8.9. The wall has thickness B; on one side of
the wall the temperature is Tl, on the other side the tempera-
ture is T2. The area of wall exposed to each temperature is A.
The rate of heat conduction through the wall is given by
the temperature gradient is negative relative to co-ordinate y
(as shown in Figure 8.9), heat flows in the positive y-direction;
conversely, if the gradient were positive (i.e. T1 < T2), heat
would flow in the negative y-direction.
Fourier's law can also be expressed in terms of heatflux, q.
Heat flux is defined as the rate of heat transfer per unit area
normal to the direction of heat flow. Therefore, from Eq.
(8.1):
~=-k
dT
'
dy
(8.2)
Fourier's law:
Q = -kA~
dT
(8.1)
where Q is rate of heat transfer, k is the thermal conductivity of
the wall, A is surface area perpendicular to the direction of heat
flow, T is temperature, and y is distance measured normal to
A. d T/dy is the temperaturegradient, or change of temperature
with distance through the wall. The negative sign in Eq. (8.1)
indicates that heat always flows from hot to cold irrespective of
whether d T/dy is positive or negative. To illustrate this, when
Figure 8.9
Heat conduction through a flat wall.
Rate of heat transfer Q is also known as power. The SI unit for
Q is the watt (W)" in imperial units Q is measured in Btu h -1.
Corresponding units of q are W m - 2 and Btu h- l ft- 2.
Thermal conductivity is a transport property of materials;
values can be found in handbooks. The dimensions of k
are L M T - 3 0 - l ;
units include W m - 1 K-1
and
Btu h - i ft-l OF-I" The magnitude of k in Eqs (8.1) and (8.2)
reflects the ease with which heat is conducted; the higher the
value of k the faster is the heat transfer. Table 8.1 lists thermal
conductivities for some common materials; metals generally
have higher thermal conductivities than other substances.
Solids with low k values are used as insulators to minimise the
rate of conduction, for example, around steam pipes or in
buildings. Thermal conductivity varies somewhat with tem-
perature; however for small ranges of temperature, k can be
considered constant.

has the same mathematical form as Eq. (8.2). In heat transfer,
the temperature gradient d T/dy is the driving force for heat
flow; in momentum transfer the driving force is the velocity
gradient dV/dy. Both heat flux and momentum flux are
directly proportional to the driving force, and the proportion-
ality constant,/~ or k, is a physical property of the material. As
we shall see in Chapter 9, the analogy between heat and
momentum transfer can be extended to include mass transfer.8 Heat Transfer

8.3.2 Steady-State Conduction
Consider again the conduction of heat through the wall shown
in Figure 8.9. At steady state there can be neither accumula-
tion nor depletion of heat within the wall; this means that the
rate of heat flow Q must be the same at each point in the wall.
If k is largely independent of temperature and A is also con-
stant, the only variables in Eq. (8.1) are temperature T and
distance y. We can therefore integrate Eq. (8.1) to obtain an
expression for rate of conduction as a function of the tempera-
ture difference across the wall.
Separating variables in Eq. (8.1) gives:
Qdy=-kAd.
(8.3)
Both sides of Eq. (8.3) can be integrated after taking the con-
stants Q, k and A outside of the integral signs:8 Heat Transfer

a single boundary condition; in this case we can use the bound-
ary condition: T - T1 at y - 0. Substituting this information
into Eq. (8.5) gives:
K = k A T I.

Thus eliminating Kfrom Eq. (8.5) gives:

In heat transfer, the A T responsible for flow of heat is known
as the temperature-difference driving force. Eq. (8.11) is an
example of the general rate principle which equates rate of
transfer to the ratio of driving force and resistance. Eq. (8.12)
can be interpreted as follows: the wall would pose more of a
resistance to heat transfer if its thickness were increased; on the
other hand, resistance is reduced if the surface area is increased,
or the material in the wall is replaced with a substance of
higher thermal conductivity.

(8.8)
Because (~ at steady state is the same at all points in the wall,
Eq. (8.8) holds for all values of y including at y -- B where
T - T2. Substituting these values into Eq. (8.8) gives the
expression:
When a system contains several different heat-transfer resis-
tances in series, the overall resistance is equal to the sum of the
individual resistances. For example, if the wall shown in Figure
8.9 were constructed of several layers of different material,
each layer would represent a separate resistance to heat trans-
fer. Consider the three-layer system illustrated in Figure 8.10
with surface area A, layer thicknesses B l, B2 and B3, thermal
conductivities k 1, k2 and k3, and temperature drops across the
layers A T1, A T2 and A Ty If the layers are in perfect thermal
contact so that there is no temperature drop across the inter-
faces, the temperature change across the entire structure is:

Eq. (8.14) represents the important principle of additivity of
resistances. We shall use this principle later for analysis of con-
vective heat transfer in pipes and stirred vessels.
8.4 Heat Transfer B e t w e e n Fluids
Convection and conduction both play important roles in heat
transfer in fluids. In agitated, single-phase systems, convective
heat transfer in the bulk fluid is linked directly to mixing and
turbulence and is generally quite rapid. However, in the heat -
exchange devices described in Section 8.1, additional
resistances are encountered.
8.4.1
Thermal
Boundary Layers
Figure 8.11 depicts the heat-transfer situation at any point on
the pipe wall of a heat exchanger. Hot and cold fluids flow on
either side of the wall; we assume that both fluids are in turbu-
lent flow. The bulk temperature of the hot fluid away from the
wall is Th; Tc is the bulk temperature of the cold fluid. Thw and
Tcw are the respective temperatures of hot and cold fluids at
the wall.
As explained in Section 7.2.3, when fluid contacts a solid, a
fluid boundary layer develops at the surface as a result of vis-
cous drag. Therefore, fluids such as those represented in Figure
8.11 consist of a turbulent core which accounts for the bulk of
the fluid, and a thin sublayer or film near the wall where the
velocity is relatively low. In the turbulent part of the fluid,
rapidly moving eddies transfer heat quickly so that any tem-
perature gradients in the bulk fluid can be neglected. The film
of liquid at the wall is called the thermal boundary layeror stag-
nantfilm, although the fluid in it is not actually stationary. This
viscous sublayer has an important effect on the rate of heat trans-
fer. Most of the resistance to heat transfer to or from the fluid is
contained in the film; the reason for this is that heat flow
through it must occur mainly by conduction rather than con-
vection because of the reduced velocity of the fluid. The width
of the film indicated by the broken lines in Figure 8.11 is the
approximate distance from the wall where the temperature
reaches the bulk-fluid temperature, either Th or Tc. The thick-
ness of the thermal boundary layer in most heat-transfer
situations is less than the hydrodynamic boundary layer
described in Section 7.2.3. In other words, as we move away
from the wall, the temperature normally reaches that of the bulk
fluid before the velocity reaches that of the bulk flow stream.
8.4.2
Individual Heat-Transfer
Coefficients
Heat exchanged between the fluids in Figure 8.11 encounters
three major resistances in series: the hot-fluid film resistance at
the wall, resistance due to the wall itself, and the cold-fluid
film resistance. Equations for rate of conduction through the
wall have already been developed in Section 8.3.2. Rate of heat
transfer through each thermal boundary layer is given by an
equation somewhat analogous to Eq. (8.10) for steady-state
conduction:8 Heat Transfer
174
^
Q =hAAT
1
(8.16)
Rc-
(8.18)
where h is the individual heat-transfer coefficient, A is the area
for heat transfer normal to the direction of heat flow, and A T
is the temperature difference between the wall and the bulk
stream. A T= Th - Thw for the hot-fluid film; A T= Tcw- Tc for
the cold-fluid film. Eq. (8.16) does not contain a separate term
for the thickness of the boundary layer; this thickness is dill-
cult to measure and depends strongly on the prevailing flow
conditions. Instead, the effect of film thickness is included in
the value of h so that, unlike thermal conductivity, values for h
cannot be found in handbooks. The heat-transfer coefficient h
is an empirical parameter incorporating the effects of system
geometry, flow conditions and fluid properties. Because it
involves fluid flow, convective heat transfer is a more complex
process than conduction. Consequently, there is little theoret-
ical basis for calculation of h; h must be determined
experimentally or evaluated using published correlations
based on experimental data. Suitable correlations for heat-
transfer coefficients are presented in Section 8.5.3. SI units for
h are W m-2 K-l; in the imperial system h is expressed as
Btu h - l fi-2 oF- I. Magnitudes of hvary greatly; some typical
values are listed in Table 8.2.
Rate of heat transfer (~ in each fluid boundary layer can be
written as the ratio of the driving force A Tand the resistance.
Therefore, from Eq. (8.16) the two resistances on either side of
the pipe wall are as follows:
where R h is the resistance to heat transfer in the hot fluid, Rc is
the resistance to heat transfer in the cold fluid, ~ is the indi-
vidual heat-transfer coefficient for the hot fluid, h is the
individual heat-transfer coefficient for the cold fluid and A is
the surface area for heat transfer.
8.4.3 Overall Heat-Transfer Coefficient
Use of Eq. (8.16) to calculate rate of heat transfer in each
boundary layer requires knowledge ofA Tfor each fluid; this is
usually difficult because of lack of information about Thw and
T . It is easier and more accurate to measure the bulk temper-
atures of fluids rather than wall temperatures. This problem is
removed by introduction of the overall heat-transfer coefficient,
U, for the total heat-flow process through both fluids and the
wall. Uis defined by the equation:
O~ = U A ~ X T =
U A ( T h - T).
(8.19)
The units of U are the same as h, e.g. W m -2 K -1 or
Btu h -1 fi-2 OF-1" Eq. (8.19) written in terms ofthe ratio of
driving force (A T) and resistance yields an expression for the
total resistance to heat flow, RT:

resistances in series, the total resistance is the sum of the indi-
vidual resistances. Applying this now to the situation of heat
exchange between fluids, RT is equal to the sum of Rh, Rw and
Rc:
RT= R h + Rw+ Rc.

(8.22)
In Eq. (8.22), the surface area A appears in each term. When
fluids are separated by a flat wall, the surface area for heat
transfer through each boundary layer and the wall is the same,
so that A can be cancelled from the equation. However, a
minor complication arises with cylindrical geometry such as
pipes. Let us assume that hot fluid is flowing inside a pipe
while cold fluid flows outside, as shown in Figure 8.12.
Because the inside diameter of the pipe is smaller than the out-
side diameter, the surface areas for heat transfer between the
fluid and the pipe wall are different for the two fluids. The sur-
face area of a cylinder is equal to its circumference multiplied
by length, i.e. A - 2~;RL where R is the radius of the cylinder
and L is its length. Therefore, the heat-transfer area at the hot-
fluid boundary layer inside the tube is Ai - 2~RiL; the
heat-transfer area at the cold-fluid film outside the tube is

Ao = 2rtRoL. The surface area available for conduction through
the wall varies between Ai and Ao-
The variation of heat-transfer area in cylindrical systems
depends on the thickness of the pipe wall; for thin walls the
variation will be relatively small. In engineering design, these
variations in surface area are incorporated into the equations
for heat transfer. However, for the sake of simplicity, in this
chapter we will ignore any differences in surface area; we will
assume in effect that the pipes are thin-walled. Accordingly,
for cylindrical as well as flat geometry, we can cancel A from
Eq. (8.22), and write a simplified equation for U:

(8.23)
The overall heat-transfer coefficient characterises the operat-
ing conditions used for heat transfer. Small Ufor a particular
process means that the system has limited capacity for heat
exchange; U can be improved by manipulating operating
conditions such as fluid velocity in shell-and-tube equipment
or stirrer speed in bioreactors. U is independent of A. Heat
transfer in an exchanger with small Ucan also be improved by
increasing the heat-transfer area andsize of the unit; however
increasing A raises the cost of the equipment. If Uis large, the
heat exchanger is well designed and is operating under condi-
tions which enhance heat transfer.
8.4.4 Fouling Factors
Heat-transfer equipment in service does not remain clean.
Dirt and scale deposit on one or both sides of the pipes, pro-
viding additional resistance to heat flow and reducing the
overall heat-transfer coefficient. Resistances to heat transfer
when fouling affects both sides of the heat-transfer surface are
represented in Figure 8.13. Five resistances are present in
series: the thermal boundary layer on the hot-fluid side, a foul-
ing layer on the hot-fluid side, the pipe wall, a fouling layer on
the cold-fluid side, and the cold-fluid boundary layer.
Each fouling layer has associated with it a heat-transfer
coefficient; for scale and dirt the coefficient is called a fouling
factor. Let hfh be the fouling factor on the hot-fluid side, and
hfc be the fouling factor on the cold-fluid side. When these
additional resistances are present, they must be included in the
expression for the overall heat-transfer coefficient, U. Eq.
(8.23) becomes:

Adding fouling factors in Eq. (8.24) increases 1/U~ thus
decreasing the value of U.
Accurate estimation of fouling factors is very difficult. The
chemical nature of the deposit and its thermal conductivity
depend on the fluid in the tube and the temperature; fouling
thickness can also vary between cleanings. Typical values of
fouling factors for various fluids are listed in Table 8.3.
8.5 Design Equations For Heat-Transfer
Systems
The basic equation for design of heat exchangers is Eq. (8.19).
If Q, Uand A Tare known, this equation allows us to calculate
A. Specification of A is a major objective of heat-exchanger
design; the surface area required dictates the configuration and
size of the equipment and its cost. In the following sections, we
will consider procedures for determining Q, Uand A T for use
in Eq. (8.19).

mine Q and all inlet and outlet temperatures used to specify

A T. These energy balances are based on general equations for
flow systems derived in Chapters 5 and 6.
Let us first consider the equations for double-pipe or
shell-and-tube heat-exchangers. From Eq. (6.10), under
steady-state conditions dE/dt= 0 and in the absence of shaft
work (r = 0), the energy-balance equation is:
Mihi-&ho-
{~m0
(8.25)
where Mi is mass flow rate in, ~Io is mass flow rate out, hi is
specific enthalpy of the incoming stream, ho is specific en-
thalpy of the outgoing stream and Q is rate of heat removal
from the system. Unfortunately, the conventional symbols for
individual heat-transfer coefficient and specific enthalpy are
the same: h. In this section, h in Eqs (8.25)-(8.30) and (8.33)
denotes specific enthalpy; otherwise in this chapter, h repre-
sents the individual heat-transfer coefficient.
Eq. (8.25) can be applied separately to each fluid in the heat
exchanger. As the mass flow rate is the same at the inlet as at
the outlet, for the hot fluid:
2~lh(hhi- hho)- (~)~h-"0
(8.26)
^
or
(hco- he)=
(8.29)
where subscript c refers to cold fluid. (~c is the rate of heat flow
into the cold fluid; therefore Qc is added rather than sub-
tracted in Eq. (8.28).
When there are no heat losses from the exchanger, all heat
removed from the hot stream is taken up by the cold stream.
We can therefore equate (~ terms in Eqs (8.27) and (8.29)"
Qh = (~c = (~" Therefore:
Mh (hhi-- hho)= 2~rc(hco- hi)= (~"
(8.30)
When sensible heat is exchanged between fluids, the enthalpy
differences in Eq. (8.30) can be expressed in terms of the heat
capacity Cp and the temperature change for each fluid. If we
assume Cp is constant over the temperature range in the
exchanger, Eq. (8.30) becomes:
2~h Cph (Thi-- Tho)--2~rcCpc ( Tco- Tci)=
(8.31)
a.,
Mh (hhi-- hho)= Qh
(8.27)
where subscript h denotes hot fluid and 0.h is the rate of heat
transfer from that fluid. Equations similar to Eqs (8.26) and
(8.27) can be derived for the cold fluid:
J~rc (hci- hco)+ (~c-"0
(8.28)
where Cphis the heat capacity of the hot fluid, Cpc is the heat
capacity of the cold fluid, Thiis the inlet temperature of the hot
fluid, Tho is the outlet temperature of the hot fluid, Tci is the
inlet temperature of the cold fluid, and Tco is the outlet tem-
perature of the cold fluid.
In heat-exchanger design, Eq. (8.31) is used to determine
Q and the inlet and outlet conditions of the fluid streams. This
is illustrated in Example 8.1.
Example 8.1 Heat exchanger
Hot, freshly-sterilised nutrient medium is cooled in a double-pipe heat exchanger before being used in a fermentation. Medium
leaving the steriliser at 121 ~ enters the exchanger at a flow rate of 10 m 3 h - 1; the desired outlet temperature is 30~ Heat from
the medium is used to raise the temperature of 25 m 3 h - 1 water initially at 15~ The system operates at steady state. Assume
that nutrient medium has the properties of water.
(a) What rate of heat transfer is required?
(b) Calculate the final temperature of the cooling water as it leaves the heat exchanger.
Solution:
The density ofwater and medium is 1000 kg m -3. Therefore:8 Heat Transfer

The exit water temperature is 52~
Eq. (8.31) can also be applied to heat removal from a reactor
for the purpose of temperature control. At steady state, the
temperature of the hot fluid, e.g. fermentation broth, does not
change; therefore the left-hand side of Eq. (8.31) is zero. If
energy is absorbed by the cold fluid as sensible heat, the
energy-balance equation becomes:
&G(Lo--
Tci)= 0 .
(8.32)
To use Eq. (8.32) for bioreactor design we must know Q. Q is
found by considering all significant heat sources and sinks in
the system; an expression involving Q for fermentation
systems was presented in Chapter 6 based on relationships
derived in Chapter 5"

where A/'trx n is the rate of heat absorption or evolution due to
metabolic reaction, ~ is the mass flow rate of evaporated liq-
uid leaving the system, A h is the latent heat of evaporation,
and Ws is the rate of shaft work done on the system. For exo-
thermic reactions A/-Irxn is negative, for endothermic reactions
A/~rxn is positive. In most fermentation systems the only
source of shaft work is the stirrer; therefore figs is the power P
dissipated by the impeller. Methods for estimating P are
described in Section 7.10. Eq. (6.12) represents a considerable
simplification of the energy balance. It is applicable to systems
in which heat of reaction dominates the energy balance so that
contributions from sensible heat and heats of solution can be
ignored. In large insulated fermenters, heat produced by meta-
bolic activity is by far the dominant source of heat; energy
dissipated by stirring may also be worth considering. The
other heat sources and sinks are relatively minor and can
generally be neglected.
At steady state dE/dt= 0 and Eq. (6.12) becomes:8 Heat Transfer

Application of Eq. (8.33) to determine 0 is illustrated in
Examples 5.7 and 5.8. Once (~ has been estimated, Eq. (8.32)
is used to evaluate unknown operating conditions as shown in
Example 8.2.
Example 8.2 Cooling coil
A 150 m 3 bioreactor is operated at 35~ to produce fungal biomass from glucose. The rate of oxygen uptake by the culture is
1.5 kg m -3 h-1; the agitator dissipates heat at a rate of I kW m -3. 60 m 3 h-1 cooling water available from a nearby river at
10~ is passed through an internal coil in the fermentation tank. If the system operates at steady state, what is the exit tempera-
ture of the cooling water?
Solution:
Rate of heat generation by aerobic cultures is calculated directly from the oxygen demand. As outlined in Section 5.9.2, approx-
imately 460 kJ heat is released for each gmol oxygen consumed. Therefore, the metabolic heat load is:

A/-]rrxn is negative because fermentation is exothermic. The rate of heat dissipation by the agitator is:

We can now calculate (~ from Eq. (8.33)"

8.5.2 Logarithmic- and Arithmetic-Mean
Temperature Differences
Application of the heat-exchanger design equation, Eq. (8.19),
requires knowledge of the temperature-difference driving
force for heat transfer, A T. A T is equal to the difference in
temperature between hot and cold fluids. However, as we have
seen in Figures 8.2, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.8, fluid temperatures vary
with position in heat exchangers; for example, the temperature
difference between hot and cold fluids at one end of the
exchanger may be more or less than at the other end. The driv-
ing force for heat transfer therefore varies from point to point
in the system. For application of Eq. (8.19), this difficulty is
overcome by use of an average A T.
If the temperature varies in both fluids in either counter-
current or cocurrent flow, the logarithmic-mean temperature
difference A TL is used:
A rg -
A
_
A rg -
A
A TL = In (A T2/A T l) - 2.303 log (A T2/A T 1)
(8.34)
where A T1 and A T2 are the temperature differences between
hot and cold fluids at the ends of the equipment. A T1and A T2
are calculated using the values for Thi, Tho, Tci and Tco
obtained from the energy balance. For convenience and to
eliminate negative numbers and their logarithms, subscripts 1
and 2 can refer to either end of the exchanger. Eq. (8.34) has
been derived using the following assumptions:
(i) the overall heat-transfer coefficient Uis constant;
(ii) the specific heats of the hot and cold fluids are constant;
(iii) heat losses from the system are negligible; and
(iv) the system is at steady-state in either countercurrent or
cocurrent flow.
The most questionable of these assumptions is that of constant
U, since this coefficient varies with temperature of the fluids.
However, because the change with temperature is gradual,
when temperature differences in the system are moderate the
assumption is not seriously in error. Other details of the deri-
vation of Eq. (8.34) can be found elsewhere [ 1,2].
Example 8.3 Log-mean temperature difference
A liquid stream is cooled from 70~ to 32~ in a double-pipe heat exchanger. Fluid flowing countercurrently with this stream is
heated from 20~ to 44~ Calculate the log-mean temperature difference.
Solution:
The heat-exchanger configuration is shown in Figure 8E3.1. At the left-hand end of the equipment, A T1= (32 - 20)~ = 12~
At the other end, A T2 - (70 - 44)~ = 26~ From Eq. (8.34):

ISI
As noted above, the log-mean temperature difference is appli-
cable to systems with cocurrent or countercurrent flow. In
multiple-pass shell-and-tube heat exchangers, flow is neither
countercurrent nor cocurrent. In these units the flow pattern is
complex, with cocurrent, countercurrent and cross-flow all
present. For shell-and-tube heat exchangers with more than a
single tube or shell pass, the log-mean temperature difference
must be used with a suitable correction factor to account for
the geometry of the exchanger. Correction factors for cross-
flow are available in other references [1-3].
When one fluid in the heat-exchange system remains at a
constant temperature such as in a fermenter, the arithmetic-
mean temperature difference A TA is the appropriate A Tto use
in heat-exchanger design:

8.5.3 Calculation of Heat-Transfer
Coefficients
As described in Sections 8.4.3 and 8.4.4, Uin Eq. (8.19) can
be determined as a combination of individual heat-transfer
coefficients, properties of the separating wall, and, if appli-
cable, fouling factors. Values of the individual heat-transfer
coefficients h h and hc depend on the thickness of the fluid
boundary layers, which is in turn strongly dependent on flow
velocity and fluid properties such as viscosity and thermal con-
ductivity. Increasing the level of turbulence and decreasing the
viscosity will reduce the thickness of the liquid film, and hence
increase the heat-transfer coefficient. Individual heat-transfer"
coefficients for flow in pipes or stirred vessels are usually evalu-
ated using empirical correlations expressed in terms of
dimensionless numbers.
The general form of correlations for heat-transfer coeffi-
cients is:
Nu = f(Reor Rei, Pr, Gr,
D/%)
L/~w
(8.36)
where f means 'some function of', and:
Nu = Nusselt number -
hD
k~o
(8.37)
Parameters in the above equations are as follows: h is the indi-
vidual heat-transfer coefficient, D is the pipe or tank diameter,
kfb is the thermal conductivity of the bulk fluid, u is the linear
velocity of fluid in the pipe, p is the average density of the
fluid, lib is the viscosity of the bulk fluid, N i is the rotational
speed of the impeller, D i is the impeller diameter, Cp is the
average heat capacity of the fluid, g is gravitational accelera-
tion, 13is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid, A T
is the variation of fluid temperature in the system, L is pipe
length, and juw is the viscosity of fluid at the wall.
The Nusselt number contains the heat-transfer coefficient
h, and represents the ratio of rates of convective and conduc-
tive heat transfer. The Prandtl number represents the ratio of
momentum and heat transfer; Pr contains physical constants
which, for Newtonian fluids, are independent of flow con-
ditions. The Grashof number represents the ratio of
gravitational to viscous forces, and appears in correlations only
when the fluid is not well mixed. Under these conditions the
fluid density is no longer uniform and natural convection
becomes an important heat-transfer mechanism. In most
industrial applications, heat transfer occurs between turbulent
fluids in pipes or in stirred vessels; forced convection in these
systems is therefore more important than natural convection
and the Grashof number is not of concern. The form of the
correlation used to evaluate Nu and therefore h depends on the
configuration of the heat-transfer equipment, the flow condi-
tions and other factors.
A wide variety of heat-transfer situations is met in practice
and there are many correlations available to biochemical engi-
neers designing heat-exchange equipment. The most common8 Heat Transfer
I82,
heat-transfer applications are as follows:8.5.3.1 Flow in tubes withoutphase change
(i)There are several widely-accepted correlations for forced con-
vection in tubes. The heat-transfer coefficient for fluid flowing
inside a tube can be calculated from the following equation [2]:
heat flow to or from fluids inside tubes, without phase
change;
(ii) heat flow to or from fluids outside tubes, without phase
change;
(iii) heat flow from condensing fluids; and
(iv) heat flow to boiling liquids.
Different equations are generally required to evaluate h h and
hc depending on the flow geometry of the hot and cold fluids.
Examples of correlations for heat-transfer coefficients in bio-
processing are given in the next section. Others can be found
in the references listed at the end of this chapter.

When flow in pipes is laminar rather than turbulent, Eqs
(8.42) and (8.43) do not apply. In liquids with Re < 2100,
fluid buoyancy and natural convection play an important role
in heat transfer. Heat-transfer correlations for laminar flow in
tubes can be found in other texts, e.g. [2].

8.5.3.2 Flow outside tubes withoutphase change
In the shell section of shell-and-tube heat exchangers, fluid
flows around the outside of the tubes. The degree of turbu-
lence, and therefore the external heat-transfer coefficient for
the shell fluid, depend in part on the geometric arrangement of
the tubes and baffles. Tubes in the exchanger may be arranged
'in line' as shown in Figure 8.14(a), or 'staggered' as shown in
Figure 8.14(b). The degree of turbulence is considerably less
for tubes in line than for staggered tubes. Because the area for
flow through a bank of staggered tubes is continually chang-
ing, this is a difficult system to analyse.
The following correlation has been proposed for flow of
fluid at right-angles to a bank of tubes more than 10 rows deep

Example 8.5 Heat-transfer coefficient for stirred vessel
A stirred fermenter of diameter 5 m contains an internal helical coil for heat transfer. The fermenter is mixed using a turbine
impeller 1.8 m in diameter operated at 60 rpm. The fermentation broth has the following properties: jub - 5 x 10 -3 Pa s;
p = 1000 kg m-3; C~-- 4.2 kJ kg- l oC - 1; kn' = 0.70 W m - 1oC - 1. Neglecting viscosity changes at the wall of the coil, calculate
the heat-transfer coemcient.

The equations of Sections 8.4 and 8.5 provide the essential ele-
ments for design of heat-transfer
systems. Eq. (8.19) is used as
A
the design equation, with Q and the inlet and outlet tempera-
tures available from energy-balance calculations as described
in Section 8.5.1. The overall heat-transfer coefficient is evalu-
ated from correlations such as those given in Section 8.5.3;
additional terms are included if the heat-transfer surfaces are
fouled. With these parameters at hand, the area required and
the size and capital cost of the equipment can be determined.
Because metabolic rates, and therefore heat-production rates,
vary during fermentation, the rate at which heat is removed
from the bioreactor must also be varied to maintain constant
temperature. Heat-transfer design is based on the maximum
heat load for the system. When the rate of heat generation
drops, operating conditions can be changed to reduce the rate
of heat removal; the simplest way of achieving this is to
decrease the cooling-water flow rate.
The procedures outlined in this chapter represent the sim-
plest and most direct approach to heat-transfer design. If
several independent variables remain unfixed prior to design
calculations, many different design outcomes are possible.
When variables such as type of fluid, mass flow rates and8 Heat Transfer

,
terminal temperatures are unspecified, they can be manipulat-
ed to produce an optimum design, e.g. the design yielding the
lowest total cost per year of operation. Computer packages
which optimise heat-exchanger design are available commer-
ciaUy.
Calculation of equipment requirements for heating or
cooling of fermenters can sometimes be simplified by consid-
ering the relative importance of each heat-transfer resistance.
For large fermentation vessels containing cooling coils, the
fluid velocity in the vessel is generally much slower than in the
coils; accordingly, the tube-side thermal boundary layer is rela-
tively thin and most of the heat-transfer resistance is located in
the fermentation medium. Especially when there is no fouling
present in the tubes, the heat-transfer coefficient for the cool-
ing water can often be omitted when calculating U. Likewise,
the wall resistance can sometimes be ignored as conduction of
heat through metal is generally very rapid. An exception is
stainless steel which is used widely in the fermentation indus-
try; the low thermal conductivity of this material means that
,
wall resistance should be taken into account if the wall thick-
ness is greater than about 5 ram.
The influence of sparging on heat transfer in stirred bioreac-
tors is not dear; however, as the effect is minor compared with
other parameters, correlations developed for ungassed systems
are applied to aerobic fermentations. For non-Newtonian
broths, apparent viscosity can be substituted for/~b in the
dimensionless groups Re, Rei and Pr; this substitution is not
straightforward when rheological parameters such as n, Kand "to
change during the culture period. Apparent viscosity also
depends on the shear rate in the fermenter which varies greatly
throughout the vessel. Correlations for heat-transfer coefficients
such as those presented in this chapter were not developed for
fermentation systems and must not be considered to give exact
values. The actual flow behaviour in many bioprocesses is poor-
ly characterised due to the effects of non-Newtonian rheology
and the presence of cells and air bubbles.
Application of heat-exchanger design equations to specify a
fermenter cooling-system is illustrated in Example 8.6.
Example 8.6 Cooling-coil length in fermenter design
A fermenter used for antibiotic production must be kept at 27~ After considering the oxygen demand of the organism and the
heat dissipation from the stirrer, the maximum heat-transfer rate required is estimated as 550 kW. Cooling water is available at
10~ the exit temperature of the cooling water is calculated using an energy balance as 25~ The heat-transfer coefficient for
the fermentation broth is estimated from Eq. (8.45) as 2150 W m -2 ~ - 1. The heat-transfer coefficient for the cooling water is
calculated as 14 000 W m -2 ~
1. It is proposed to install a helical cooling coil inside the fermenter; the outer diameter of the
coil pipe is 8 cm, the pipe thickness is 5 mm and the thermal conductivity of the steel is 60 W m-1 oC -1. An average internal
fouling-factor of 8500 W m -2 ~ - 1 is expected; the fermenter side surface of the coil is kept relatively clean. What length of
cooling coil is required?

8.6.1 Relationship Between Heat Transfer,
Cell Concentration and Stirring Conditions
The design equation (8.19) and the energy-balance equation
(8.33) allow us to derive some important relationships for fer-
menter operation. Because cell metabolism is usually the
largest source of heat in fermenters, the capacity of the system
for heat removal can be linked directly to the maximum cell
concentration in the reactor. Assuming that heat dissipated
from the stirrer and the cooling effects of evaporation a r e
negligible compared with the heat of reaction, Eq. (8.33)
becomes:
(~ = (460 kJ gmo1-1) Qo v.
(8.49)
If qo is the specific oxygen-uptake rate, or rate of oxygen
consumption per unit cell, Qo = qo x where x is cell concen-
tration. Typical units for qo are gmol g- 1 s-1. Therefore:
= (460 kJ gmol-1) q o x V "
(8.50)
Substituting this into Eq. (8.19) gives:
(460 kJ gmol- l) q o x V = UA A T.
= --A/-;rrx ..
(8.47)(8.5])
In aerobic fermentation, heat of reaction is related to the rate
of oxygen consumption by the cells. As outlined in Section
5.9.2, approximately 460 kJ heat is released for each gmol oxy-
gen consumed. If Qo is the rate of oxygen uptake per unit
volume in the fermenter:The fastest rate of heat transfer occurs when the temperature
difference between fermenter contents and cooling water is
maximum. Hypothetically, this occurs when the cooling water
remains at its inlet temperature, i.e. A T= ( TF - Tci) where TF
is the fermentation temperature and Tci is the water inlet tem-
perature. Therefore, we can determine from Eq. (8.51) the
maximum cell concentration supported by the heat-transfer
system:
A/~rx n = (--460 kJ gmo1-1) Qo v
(8.48)
where Vis the reactor volume. Typical units for Qo are gmol
m -3 s-1. A/~rxn in Eq. (8.48) is negative because the reaction
is exothermic. Substituting this equation in Eq. (8.47):
UA ( T F -
Xmax -~"
Li )
(460 kJ gmo1-1) qo V
(8.52)8 Heat Transfer
It is undesirable for biomass concentration in fermenters to be
limited by heat-transfer capacity. Therefore, if the maximum
cell concentration estimated using Eq. (8.52) is lower than
that desired in the process, the heat-transfer facilities must be
improved. For example, area A could be increased by installing
a longer cooling coil, or the overall heat-transfer coefficient
could be improved by increasing the stirrer speed. Eq. (8.52)
was derived for fermenters in which shaft work could be
ignored; if stirrer power adds significantly to the total heat
load, Xmax will be somewhat smaller than that calculated.
It should be evident from Chapters 7 and 8 that mixing
and heat transfer are not independent functions in bioreac-
tors. Agitation rate and stirrer size affect the value of the
heat-transfer coefficient in the fermentation fluid; turbu-
lence in the reactor decreases the thickness of the thermal
boundary layer and facilitates rapid heat transfer. However,
stirring also generates heat and contributes to the total heat
load that must be removed from the reactor to maintain con-
stant temperature. Heat removal can be a severe problem in
bioreactors if the fluid is viscous; turbulence and high heat-
transfer coefficients are difficult to achieve in highly viscous
liquids without enormous power input which itself generates
an extra heat load. These relationships are explored further in
Problem 8.8.

This heat is removed to cooling water flowing in a helical
stainless-steel coil inside the vessel. The coil wall thickness
is 6 mm and the thermal conductivity of the metal is

eter 12 cm; the exit water temperature is 28~ After the inner
and outer surfaces of the coil are cleaned it is found that only

tion temperature.

single-pass countercurrent shell-and-tube heat exchanger
before being pumped into a fed-batch fermenter. Medium
passes through the tubes of the exchanger; the shell-side fluid is

ture 60~
Pre-heated medium is required at a rate of
50 m 3 h -1. The density, viscosity and heat capacity of the
medium are the same as water; the thermal conductivity of the
medium is 0.54 W m - 1 o C - 1.
It is proposed to use 30 steel tubes with inner diameter
5 cm; the tubes will be arranged in line. The pipe wall is
5-mm thick; the thermal conductivity of the metal is

8.7 Suitability of an existing cooling-coil
An enzyme manufacturer in the same industrial park as your
antibiotic factory has a re-conditioned 20 m 3 fermenter for
sale. You are in the market for a cheap 20 m 3 fermenter; how-
ever the vessel on offer is fitted with a 45-m steel helical
cooling-coil with inner pipe-diameter 7.5 cm. You propose to
use the fermenter for your newest production organism
which is known to have a maximum oxygen demand of
90 mol m -3 h-1 at its optimum culture temperature of 28~
You consider that the 3-m diameter vessel should be stirred
with a 1-m diameter turbine-impeller operated at an average
speed of 50 rpm. The fermentation fluid can be assumed to
have the properties of water. If 20 m 3 h-1 cooling water at

hand fermenter and cooling coil?

Mass Transfer
Mass transfer occurs in mbctures containing local concentration variations. For example, when dye is dropped into a pail of
water, mass-transferprocesses are responsible for movement of dye molecules through the water until equilibrium is
established and the concentration is uniform. Mass is transferred fiom one location to another under the influence of a
concentration difference or concentration gradient in the system.
There are many situations in bioprocessing where concentra-
tions of compounds are not uniform; we rely on mechanisms of
mass transfer to transport material from regions of high concen-
tration to regions where the concentration is low. An example
is the supply of oxygen in fermenters for aerobic culture.
Concentration of oxygen at the surface of air bubbles is high
compared with the rest of the fluid; this concentration gradient
promotes oxygen transfer from the bubbles into the medium.
Another example of mass transfer is extraction of penicillin from
fermentation liquor using organic solvents such as butyl acetate.
When solvent is added to the broth, the relatively low concen-
tration of penicillin in the organic phase causes mass transfer of
penicillin into the solvent. Solvent extraction is an efficient
downstream-processing technique as it selectively removes the
desired product from the rest of the fermentation fluid.
Mass transfer plays a vital role in many reaction systems. As
distance between the reactants and site of reaction becomes
greater, rate of mass transfer is more likely to influence or con-
trol the conversion rate. Taking again the example of oxygen
in aerobic culture, if mass transfer of oxygen from the bubbles
is slow, the rate of cell metabolism will become dependent on
the rate of oxygen supply from the gas phase. Because oxygen is
a critical component of aerobic fermentations and is so spar-
ingly soluble in aqueous solutions, much of our interest in
mass transfer lies with the transfer of oxygen across gas-liquid
interfaces. However, liquid-solid mass transfer can also be
important in systems containing clumps, pellets, flocs or films
of cells or enzymes; in these cases, nutrients in the liquid phase
must be transported into the solid before they can be utilised
in reaction. Unless mass transfer is rapid, supply of nutrients
will limit the rate of biological conversion.
In a solid or quiescent fluid, mass transfer occurs as a result
of molecular diffusion. However, most mass-transfer systems
contain moving fluid; in turbulent flow, mass transfer by
molecular motion is supplemented by convective transfer.
There is an enormous variety of circumstances in which con-
vective mass transfer takes place. In this chapter, we will
consider the theory of mass transfer with applications relevant
to the bioprocessing industry.
9.1 Molecular Diffusion
Molecular diffusion is the movement of component molecules
in a mixture under the influence of a concentration difference
in the system. Diffusion of molecules occurs in the direction
required to destroy the concentration gradient. If the gradient
is maintained by constantly supplying material to the region of
high concentration and removing it from the region of low
concentration, diffusion will be continuous. This situation is
often exploited in mass-transfer operations and reaction
systems.
9.1.1
Diffusion Theory
In this text, we confine our discussion of diffusion to binary
mixtures, i.e. mixtures or solutions containing only two com-
ponents. Consider a system containing molecular components
A and B. Initially, the concentration of A in the system is not
uniform; as indicated in Figure 9.1, concentration CA varies
from CAI tO CA2 is a function of distance y. In response to this
concentration gradient, molecules of A will diffuse away from
the region of high concentration until eventually the whole
system acquires uniform composition. If there is no large-scale
fluid motion in the system, e.g. due to stirring, mixing occurs
solely by random molecular movement.
Assume that mass transfer of A occurs across area a perpen-
dicular to the direction of diffusion. In single-phase systems,
the rate of mass transfer due to molecular diffusion is given by
Fick's law of diffusion, which states that mass flux is propor-
tional to the concentration gradient:9 Mass Transfer

When diffusivity values are not available for the exact tem-
perature and pressure of interest, ~AB can be estimated using
equations. Relationships for calculating diffusivities are avail-
able from other references [1-3]. The theory of diffusion in
liquids is not as well advanced as with gases; thereare also
fewer experimental data available for liquid systems.

9.1.2 Analogy Between Mass, Heat and
Momentum Transfer

There is a close similarity between the processes of mass, heat
and momentum transfer occurring as a result of molecular
motion. This is suggested by the form of the equations for
mass, heat and momentum fluxes:
dG
dy
(9.1)
In Eq. (9.1), Ja is the massflux of component A, N a is the rate of
mass transfer of component A, a is the area across which mass
transfer occurs, .~SABis the binary diffusion coefficient or diffusiv-
ity of component A in a mixture of A and B, Ca is the
concentration of component A, and y is distance, d CA / dy is the
concentration gradient, or change in concentration of A with
distance. As indicated in Eq. (9.1), mass flux is defined as the
rate of mass transfer per unit area perpendicular to the direction
of movement; JA has units of, e.g. gmol s -1 m -2.
Corresponding units for N A are gmol s-1, for CA gmol m -3,
and for _~SABm 2 s-1. Mass rather than mole units may be used
for JA, NA and CA; Eq. (9.1) holds in either case. Eq. (9.1) indi-
cates that rate of diffusion can be enhanced by increasing the
area available for mass transfer, the concentration gradient in the
system, and the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient. The neg-
ative sign in Eq. (9.1) indicates that the direction of mass
transfer is always from high concentration to low concentration,
opposite to that of the concentration gradient. In other words, if
the slope of CA versus y is positive as in Figure 9.1, the direction
of mass transfer is in the negative y-direction, and vice versa.
The diffusion coefficient ~AB is a property of materials;
values can be found in handbooks. "-~ABreflects the ease with
which diffusion takes place. Its value depends on both compo-
nents of the mixture; for example, the diffusivity of carbon
dioxide in water will be different from the diffusivity of carbon
dioxide in another solvent such as ethanol. The value of.~AB is
also dependent on temperature. Diffusivity of gases varies with
pressure; for liquids there is an approximate linear dependence

The three processes represented above are quite different on
the molecular level, but the basic equations have the same
form. In each case, flux in the y-direction is directly propor-
tional to the driving force (either d C~dy, d TIdy or dVldy),
with the proportionality constant (~SaB, k or/~) a physical
property of the material. The negative signs in Eqs (9.2), (8.2)
and (7.6) indicate that transfer of mass, heat or momentum is
always in the direction opposite to that of increasing concen-
tration, temperature or velocity. The similarity in the form of
the three rate equations makes it possible in some situations to
apply analysis of one process to either of the other two.
The analogy of Eqs (9.2), (8.2) and (7.6) is valid for trans-
port of mass, heat and momentum resulting from motion or
vibration of molecules. Extension of the analogy to turbulent
flow is generally valid for heat and mass transfer; however the9 Mass Transfer
analogy with momentum transfer presents a number of diffi-
culties. Several analogy theories have been proposed in the
chemical engineering literature to describe simultaneous
transport phenomena in turbulent systems. Details are pre-
sented elsewhere [2, 4, 5].

Fluid mixing is carried out in most industrial processes where
mass transfer takes place. Bulk fluid motion causes more rapid
large-scale mixing than molecular diffusion; why then is diffu-
sive transport still important? Areas ofbioprocessing in which
diffusion plays a major role are described below.
(i)
Scaleof mixing. As discussed in Section 7.9.3, turbulence
in fluids produces bulk mixing on a scale equal to the
smallest eddy size. Within the smallest eddies, flow is
largely streamline so that further mixing must occur by
diffusion of fluid components. Mixing on a molecular
scale therefore relies on diffusion as the final step in the
mixing process.
(ii) Solid-phase reaction. In biological systems, reactions are
sometimes mediated by catalysts in solid form, e.g.
clumps, flocs and films of cells and immobilised-enzyme
and -cell particles. When cells or enzyme molecules are
clumped together into a solid particle, substrates must be
transported into the solid before reaction can take place.
Mass transfer within solid particles is usually unassisted
by bulk fluid convection; the only mechanism for
intraparticle mass transfer is molecular diffusion. As the
reaction proceeds, diffusion is also responsible for remov-
al of product molecules away from the site of reaction. As
discussed more fully in Chapter 12, when reaction is
coupled with diffusion, the overall reaction rate can be
significantly reduced if diffusion is slow.
(iii) Mass transferacrossaphase boundary. Mass transfer between
phases occurs often in bioprocessing. Oxygen transfer from
gas bubbles to fermentation broth, penicillin recovery
from aqueous to organic liquid, and glucose transfer from
liquid medium into mould pellets are typical examples.
When different phases come into contact, fluid velocity
near the phase interface is significantly decreased and diffu-
sion becomes crucial for mass transfer across the phase
interface. This is discussed further in the next section.
9.3 Film Theory
The two-film theory is a useful model for mass transfer between
phases. Mass transfer of solute from one phase to another
involves transport from the bulk of one phase to the phase

boundary or interface, and then from the interface to the bulk
of the second phase. The film theory is based on the idea that a
fluid film or mass-transfer boundary layer forms wherever there
is contact between two phases.
Let us consider mass transfer of component A across the
phase interface represented in Figure 9.2. Assume that the
phases are two immiscible liquids such as water and chloro-
form, and that A is initially at higher concentration in the
aqueous phase than in the organic phase. Each phase is well
mixed and in turbulent flow. The concentration of A in the
bulk aqueous phase is CAI; the concentration of A in the bulk
organic phase is C~z.
According to the film theory, turbulence in each fluid dies
out at the phase boundary. A thin film of relatively stagnant
fluid exists on either side of the interface; mass transfer
through this film is effected solely by molecular diffusion. The
concentration of A changes near the interface as indicated in
Figure 9.2; CAI i is the interfacial concentration of A in the
aqueous phase; CA2 i is the interfacial concentration of A in the
organic phase. Most of the resistance to mass transfer resides in
the liquid films rather than in the bulk liquid. For practical
purposes it is generally assumed that there is negligible resist-
ance to transport at the interface itself; this is equivalent to
assuming that the phases are in equilibrium at the plane of9 Mass Transfer
I93
contact. The difference between CA1 i and CA2 i at the interface
accounts for the possibility that, at equilibrium, A may be
more soluble in one phase than in the other. For example, ifA
were acetic acid in contact at the interface with both water and
chloroform, the equilibrium concentration in water would be
greater than that in chloroform by a factor of between 5 and
10. CAI i would then be significantly higher than C~i.
Even though the bulk liquids in Figure 9.2 may be well
mixed, diffusion of component A is crucial in effecting mass
transfer because the local fluid velocities approach zero at the
interface. The film theory as described above is applied exten-
sively in analysis of mass transfer, although it is a greatly
simplified representation. There are other models of mass trans-
fer in fluids which lead to more realistic mathematical outcomes
than the film theory [1, 4]. Nevertheless, irrespective of how
mass transfer is visualised, diffusion is always an important
mechanism of mass transfer close to the interface between fluids.
where N A is the rate of mass transfer of component A, k is the
mass-transfer coefficient, a is the area available for masstrans-
fer, CAo is the bulk concentration of component A away from
the phase boundary, and C~ is the concentration of A at the
interface. Eq. (9.3) is usually used to represent the volumetric
rate of mass transfer, so units of N A are, for example,
gmol m -3 s -1. Consistent with this representation, a is the
interfacial area per unit volume with dimensions L -1 and
units of, for example, m 2 m -3 or m -1. The dimensions of
the ma~s-transfer coefficient are LT-I; SI units are m s -1.
Eq. (9.3) indicates that the rate of convective mass transfer can
be enhanced by increasing the area available for mass transfer,
the concentration difference between the bulk fluid and the
interface, and the magnitude of the mass-transfer coefficient.
By analogy with Eq. (8.11) for heat transfer, Eq. (9.3) can also
be written in the form:
NA-Rm
9.4 Convective Mass Transfer
The term convective mass transfer refers to mass transfer occur-
ring in the presence of bulk fluid motion. Molecular diffusion
will occur whenever there is a concentration gradient; however
if the bulk fluid is also moving, the overall rate of mass transfer
will be higher due to the contribution of convective currents.
Analysis of mass transfer is most important in multi-phase
systems where interfacial boundary layers provide significant
mass-transfer resistance. Let us develop an expression for rate
of mass transfer which is applicable to mass-transfer boundary
layers.
Rate of mass transfer is directly proportional to the driving
force for transfer, and the area available for the transfer process
to take place. This can be expressed as:
Transfer rate oc (transfer area) • (driving force).
The proportionality coefficient in this equation is called the
mass-transfer coefficient, so that:
Transfer rate = (mass-transfer coefficient) • (transfer area)
• (driving force).
For each fluid on either side of a phase boundary, the driving
force for mass transfer can be expressed in terms of a concen-
tration difference. Therefore, rate of mass transfer to a phase
boundary is given by the equation:
NA= k a A CA= k a ( CAo - C~)
(9.3)
(9.4)
where Rm is the resistance to mass transfer:
1
(9.5)
Mass transfer coupled with fluid flow is a more complicated
process than diffusive mass transfer. The value of the mass-
transfer coefficient reflects the contribution to mass transfer
from all the processes in the system that affect the boundary
layer. Like the heat-transfer coefficient in Chapter 8, k
depends on the combined effects of flow velocity, geometry of
the mass-transfer system, and fluid properties such as viscosity
and diffusivity. Because the hydrodynamics of most practical
systems are not easily characterised, k cannot be calculated
reliably from first principles. Instead, it is measured experi-
mentally or estimated using correlations available from the
literature. In general, reducing the thickness of the boundary
layer or improving the diffusion coefficient in the film will
result in enhancement of k and improvement in the rate of
mass transfer.
Three mass-transfer situations which occur in bioprocess-
ing are liquid-solid mass transfer, liquid-liquid mass transfer
between immiscible solvents and gas-liquid mass transfer. Use
of Eq. (9.3) to determine the rate of mass transfer in these
systems is discussed in the following sections.9 Mass Transfer
194
9.4.1 Liquid-Solid Mass Transfer
Figure 9.3
Mass transfer between a moving liquid and a solid is important
in biological processing in a variety of applications. Transport
of substrates to solid-phase cell or enzyme catalysts has already
been mentioned. Adsorption of molecules onto surfaces, such
as in chromatography, requires transport from liquid phase to
solid; liquid-solid mass transfer is also important in crystallisa-
tion as molecules move from the liquid to the face of the
growing crystal. Conversely, the process of dissolving a solid in
liquid requires liquid-solid mass transfer directed away from
the solid surface.
Let us assume that component A is required for reaction at
the surface of a solid. The situation at the interface between
flowing liquid containing A and the solid is illustrated in
Figure 9.3. Near the interface, the fluid velocity is reduced and
a boundary layer develops. As A is consumed by reaction, the
local concentration of A at the surface decreases and a concen-
tration gradient is established through the film. The
concentration difference between the bulk liquid and the
phase interface drives mass transfer of A from the liquid to the
solid, allowing the reaction to continue. If the solid is non-por-
ous, A does not penetrate further than the surface. The
concentration of A at the phase boundary is CAi; the concen-
tration of A in the bulk liquid outside the film is CAo. If a is the
liquid-solid interfacial area per unit volume, the volumetric
rate of mass transfer can be determined from Eq. (9.3) as:
NA = kL a ( CAo - GAi )
(9.6)
where kL is the liquid-phase mass-transfer coefficient.
Application of Eq. (9.6) requires knowledge of the mass-
transfer coefficient, the interfacial area between the phases, the
bulk concentration of A, and the concentration of A at the
interface. Bulk compositions are generally easy to measure; in
simple cases, area a can be determined from the shape and size
of the solid. The value of the mass-transfer coefficient is either
measured or calculated using published correlations.
Estimation of the interfacial concentration C~ is more diffi-
cult; measuring compositions at phase boundaries is not easy
experimentally. To overcome this problem, we must consider
the processes in the system which are linked to mass transfer of
A. In the example of Figure 9.3, transport of A is linked to
reaction at the surface of the solid, so that the value of C/ti will
depend on the rate of consumption of A at the interface. In
practical terms, we can therefore calculate the rate of mass
transfer of A only if we have information about the rate of reac-
tion at the solid surface. Simultaneous reaction and mass
transfer occurs in many bioprocesses; Chapter 12 treats solid-
phase reaction coupled with mass transfer in more detail.

9.4.2 Liquid-Liquid Mass Transfer
Liquid-liquid mass transfer between immiscible solvents is
most often encountered in the product-recovery stages ofbio-
processing. Organic solvents are used to isolate antibiotics,
steroids and alkaloids from fermentation broths; two-phase
aqueous systems are used in protein purification. Liquid-
liquid mass transfer is also important when hydrocarbons are
used as substrates in fermentation, e.g. in production of
microbial biomass for single-cell protein.
The situation at the interface between two immiscible
liquids is shown in Figure 9.2. Component A is present at bulk
concentration CAI in one liquid phase; this concentration falls
tO CAI i at the interface. In the other liquid, the concentration
of A falls from CA2i at the interface to CA2 in the bulk. The rate
of mass transfer N A in each liquid phase can be obtained from
Eq. (9.3):
NA1 = ALl a (CA1 -- CAli)
(9.7)
and
N ~ = kL2 a ( CA2 i -- CA2 )
(9.8)
where k L is the liquid-phase mass-transfer coefficient, and sub-9 Mass Transfer
I95
scripts 1 and 2 refer to the two liquid phases. As mentioned
already in Section 9.4.1, application of Eqs (9.7) and (9.8) is
difficult because we cannot easily measure interfacial concen-
trations. However, in this case these terms can be eliminated
by considering the physical situation at the interface and
manipulating the equations.
First, let us recognise that at steady state, because there can
be no accumulation of A at the interface or anywhere else in
the system, any A transported through liquid 1 must also
be transported through liquid 2. This means that NAI in
Eq. (9.7) must be equal to N ~ in Eq. (9.8); we will call NAI =
N ~ = N A. We can then rearrange Eqs (9.7) and (9.8):

Normally, it can be assumed that there is negligible resistance
to mass transfer at the actual interface, i.e. within distances
corresponding to molecular free paths on either side of the
phase boundary. This is equivalent to assuming that the phases
are in equilibrium at the interface; therefore, CAI i and CA2i are
equilibrium concentrations. The assumption of phase-bound-
ary equilibrium has been subjected to many tests. As a result it
is known that there are special situations, such as when there is
adsorption of material at the interface, where the assumption
is invalid. However, in ordinary situations, the evidence is that
equilibrium does exist at the interface between phases. Note
that we are not proposing to relate bulk concentrations CA1
and C ~ using equilibrium relationships, only CAI i and C~i.
If the bulk liquids were in equilibrium, no nett mass transfer
would take place.
A typical equilibrium curve relating concentrations of
solute A in two immiscible liquid phases is shown in Figure
9.4. The points making up the curve are obtained readily from
experiments; alternatively equilibrium data can be found in
handbooks. Equilibrium distribution of one solute between
two phases is conveniently described in terms of the distribu-
tion law. At equilibrium, the ratio of solute concentrations in
the two phases is given by the distribution coefficient or parti-
tion coefficient, m. As shown in Figure 9.4, when the
concentration of A is low, the equilibrium curve is approxi-

mately a straight line, so that m is constant. The distribution
law is accurate only if both solvents are immiscible and there is
no chemical reaction.
Therefore if CAI i and CA2 i are equilibrium concentrations,
they can be related using the distribution coefficient m.

Eqs (9.18) and (9.19) combine mass-transfer resistances in the
two liquid films, and relate the rate of mass transfer N A to the
bulk fluid concentrations CAI and C ~ . The bracketed terms
for the combined mass-transfer coefficients are used to
define the overall liquid-phase mass-transfer co~r

where KL1 and KL2 are given by Eqs (9.20) and (9.21). Use of
either of these two equations requires knowledge of the con-
centrations of A in the bulk fluids, the partition coefficient m,
the interfacial area a between the two liquid phases, and the
value of either KL1 or KL2. CA1 and CA2 are generally easy to
measure, m can also be measured, or is found in handbooks of
physical properties. The overall mass-transfer coefficients can
be measured experimentally, or are estimated from published
correlations for kL1 and kL2 in the literature. The only
remaining parameter is the interfacial area, a. In many appli-
cations of liquid-liquid mass transfer it is difficult to know
how much interfacial area is available between phases. For
example, liquid-liquid extraction is often carried out in
stirred tanks where an impeller is used to disperse and mix
droplets of one phase through the other. The interfacial area
under these circumstances will depend on the size, shape and
number of the droplets, which will in turn depend on the
intensity of agitation and properties of the fluid. Because
these factors also affect the value of k L, correlations for mass-
transfer coefficients are often given in terms of kLa as a
combined parameter.
Eqs (9.22) and (9.23) indicate that the rate of mass transfer
between two phases is not dependent simply on the concentra-
tion difference; the equilibrium relationship is also an
important factor. According to Eq. (9.22), the driving force for
transfer of A out of liquid 1 is the difference between the bulk
concentration CAI and the concentration of A in liquid 1 which
would be in equilibrium with concentration C ~ in liquid 2.
Similarly, the driving force for mass transfer according to Eq.
(9.23) is the difference between C ~ and the concentration of A
in liquid 2 which would be in equilibrium with CAIin liquid 1.

liquid is analysed in a similar way to liquid-liquid and
liquid-solid mass transfer.
Figure 9.5 shows the situation at an interface between gas
and liquid phases containing component A. Let us assume that
A is transferred from the gas phase into the liquid. The con-
centration of A in the liquid is CAt, in the bulk and CALi at the
interface. In the gas, the concentration is CAG in the bulk and
CAGi at the interface.
From Eq. (9.3), the rate of mass transfer of A through the

(9.25)
where k G is the gas-phase mass-transfer coefficient and k L is
the liquid-phase mass-transfer coefficient. To eliminate CAGi
and CALi, we must manipulate the equations as in Section
9.4.2.
If we assume that equilibrium exists at the interface, CAGi
and CALi can be related. For dilute concentrations of most
gases and for a wide range of concentration for some gases,
equilibrium concentration in the gas phase is a linear function
of liquid concentration. Therefore, we can write:
The rate of mass transfer in gas-liquid systems can therefore be
expressed using either of two equations:
N A = K G a(CAG -
mCAL)
(9.32)
or
N A - KL a ( CAGm
(9.33)9 Mass Transfer
198
Eqs (9.32) and (9.33) are usually expressed using equilibrium
concentrations, mCaL is equal to C~tG , the gas-phase concen-
tration of A in equilibrium with CAt., and (cA6/,) is equal to
C~L, the liquid-phase concentration of A in equilibrium with
CaG. Eqs (9.32) and (9.33) become:
N a = K Ga (CaG - C~tG)
(9.34)
and
N a = K La (C~L - CaL).
(9.35)
In real mass-transfer systems, obtaining the values of CAG,
C~ L and m in Eqs (9.32) and (9.33) is reasonably straightfor-
ward. However, as in liquid-liquid mass-transfer systems, it is
generally difficult to evaluate the interfacial area a. When gas is
sparged through a liquid the interfacial area will depend on the
size and number of bubbles present, which in turn depend on
many other factors such as medium composition, stirrer speed
and gas flow rate. Mass-transfer coefficients are measured
experimentally or estimated using empirical correlations from
the literature.
Eqs (9.34) and (9.35) can be simplified for systems in
which most of the resistance to mass transfer lies in either the
gas-phase interfacial film or the liquid-phase film. When
solute A is very soluble in the liquid, for example in transfer of
ammonia to water, the liquid-side resistance is small compared
with that posed by the gas interfacial film. Therefore, from Eq.
(9.5), if the liquid-side resistance is small kLa must be rela-
tively large; from Eq. (9.30), K G a is then approximately equal
to k G a. Using this result in Eq. (9.34) gives:
N A = k G a ( CAG -
C ~ G )"
(9.36)
Conversely, if A is poorly soluble in the liquid, e.g. oxygen in
aqueous solution, the liquid-phase mass-transfer resistance
dominates and k G a is much larger than k La. From Eq. (9.31),
this means that K La is approximately equal to kLa, and Eq.
(9.35) can be simplified to:
N A = k La ( C ; t l -
CAL).
(9.37)
9.5 Oxygen Uptake in Cell Cultures
Cells in aerobic culture take up oxygen from the liquid. The
rate of oxygen transfer from gas to liquid is therefore of prime
importance, especially at high cell densities when cell growth is
likely to be limited by availability of oxygen in the medium. An
expression for rate of oxygen transfer from gas to liquid is given
by Eq. (9.37); N a is the rate of oxygen transfer per unit volume
of fluid (gmol m -3 s-I), k L is the liquid-phase mass-transfer
coefficient (m s- 1), a is the gas-liquid interfacial area per unit
volume of fluid (m 2 m-3), CAL is the oxygen concentration in
the broth (gmol m-3), and C~tL is the oxygen concentration in
the broth in equilibrium with the gas phase (gmol m-3). The
equilibrium concentration C~tL is also known as the solubilityof
oxygen in the broth. The difference (C~tL - CaL) between the
maximum possible and actual oxygen concentrations in the
liquid represents the concentration-difference driving force for
mass transfer.
The solubility of oxygen in aqueous solutions at ambient
temperature and pressure is only about 10 ppm. This amount
of oxygen is quickly consumed in aerobic cultures and must be
constantly replaced by sparging. For an actively respiring yeast
population with a cell density of 109 cells per ml, it can be cal-
culated that the oxygen content of the broth must be replaced
about 12 times per minute to keep up with cellular oxygen
demand [6]. This is not an easy task because the low solubility
of oxygen guarantees that the concentration difference
(C~tL - CAL) is always very small. Design of fermenters for
aerobic operation must take these factors into account and
provide optimum mass-transfer conditions.
9.5.1 FactorsAffecting Cellular Oxygen
Demand
The rate at which oxygen is consumed by cells in fermenters
determines the rate at which it must be transferred from gas to
liquid. Many factors influence oxygen demand; the most
important of these are cell species, culture growth phase, and
nature of the carbon source in the medium. In batch culture,
rate of oxygen uptake varies with time. The reasons for this are
twofold. First, the concentration of cells increases during the
course of batch culture and the total rate of oxygen uptake is
proportional to the number of cells present. In addition, the
rate of oxygen consumption per cell, known as the specific oxy-
gen uptake rate, also varies. Typically, specific oxygen demand
passes through a maximum in early exponential phase as illus-
trated in Figure 9.6, even though the cell concentration is
relatively small at that time. If Qo is the oxygen uptake rate
per volume of broth and qo is the specific oxygen uptake rate:
Qo = qo x
(9.38)
where x is cell concentration. Typical units for qo are
g g-1 s-l, and for Qo, g 1-1 s-i-9 Mass Transfer

The inherent demand of an organism for oxygen (qo)
depends primarily on the biochemical nature of the cell and its
nutritional environment. However, when the level of dis-
solved oxygen in the medium falls below a certain point, the
specific rate of oxygen uptake is also dependent on the oxygen
concentration in the liquid. The dependence of qo on C~L is
shown in Figure 9.7. If CAT.is above the critical oxygen concen-
tration Ccrit, qo is a constant maximum and independent of
C~LL. If CAL is below Ccrit, qo is approximately linearly depen-
dent on oxygen concentration.
To eliminate oxygen limitations and allow cell metabolism
to function at its fastest, the dissolved-oxygen concentration at
every point in the fermenter must be above Ccrit. The exact
value of Ccrit depends on the organism, but under average
operating conditions usually falls between 5% and 10% of air
saturation. For cells with relatively high Ccrit levels, the task of
transferring sufficient oxygen to maintain CAL > Ccritis always
more challenging than for cultures with low Ccrit values.
Choice of substrate for the fermentation can also signifi-
cantly affect oxygen demand. Because glucose is generally con-
sumed more rapidly than other sugars or carbon-containing
substrates, rates of oxygen demand are higher when glucose is
used. For example, maximum oxygen-consumption rates of
5.5, 6.1 and 12 mmol l- 1 h - 1 have been observed for
Penicillium mould growing on lactose, sucrose and glucose,
respectively [7].
9.5.2 Oxygen Transfer From Gas Bubble to
Cell
In aerobic fermentation, oxygen molecules must overcome a
series of transport resistances before being utilised by the cells.
Eight mass-transfer steps involved in transport of oxygen
from the interior of gas bubbles to the site of intracellular
reaction are represented diagrammatically in Figure 9.8. They
are:
(i).
transfer from the interior of the bubble to the gas-liquid
interface;
(ii) movement across the gas-liquid interface;
(iii) diffusion through the relatively stagnant liquid film sur-
rounding the bubble;
(iv) transport through the bulk liquid;
(v) diffusion through the relatively stagnant liquid film sur-
rounding the cells;
(vi) movement across the liquid-cell interface;
(vii) if the cells are in a floc, clump or solid particle, diffusion
through the solid to the individual cell; and
(viii) transport through the cytoplasm to the site of reaction.
Note that resistance due to the gas boundary layer on the inside
of the bubble has been neglected; because of the low solu-
bility of oxygen :in aqueous solutions, we can assume that the
liquid-film resistance dominates gas-liquid mass transfer (see9 Mass Transfer

rather than in a clump, step (vii) disappears.
The relative magnitudes of the various mass-transfer resis-
tances depend on the composition and rheological properties
of the liquid, mixing intensity, bubble size, cell-clump size,
interfacial adsorption characteristics and other factors. For
most bioreactors the following analysis is valid.
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
Transfer through the bulk gas phase in the bubble is
relatively fast.
The gas-liquid interface itself contributes negligible
resistance.
The liquid film around the bubbles is a major resistance
to oxygen transfer.
In a well-mixed fermenter, concentration gradients in
the bulk liquid are minimised and mass-transfer resist-
ance in this region is small. However, rapid mixing can
be difficult to achieve in viscous fermentation broths; if
this is the case, oxygen-transfer resistance in the bulk
liquid may be important.
Because single cells are much smaller than gas bubbles,
the liquid film surrounding each cell is much thinner
than that around the bubbles and its effect on mass
transfer can generally be neglected. On the other hand,
if the cells form large clumps, liquid-film resistance can
be significant.
(vi) Resistance at the cell-liquid interface is generally
neglected.
(vii) When the cells are in clumps, intraparticle resistance is
likely to be significant as oxygen has to diffuse through
the solid pellet to reach the interior cells. The magni-
tude of this resistance depends on the size of the clumps.
(viii) Intracellular oxygen-transfer resistance is negligible
because of the small distances involved.
When cells are dispersed in the liquid and the bulk fermen-
tation broth is well mixed, the major resistance to oxygen transfer
is the liquidfllm surrounding the gas bubbles. Transport through
this film becomes the rate-limiting step in the complete pro-
cess, and controls the overall mass-transfer rate. Consequently,
the rate of oxygen transfer from the bubble all the way to the
cell is dominated by the rate of step (iii). The mass-transfer rate
for this step can be calculated using Eq. (9.37).
At steady state there can be no accumulation of oxygen at
any location in the fermenter; therefore, the rate of oxygen
transfer from the bubbles must be equal to the rate of oxygen9 Mass Transfer

consumption by the cells. Ifwe make N A in Eq. (9.37) equal to
Qo in Eq. (9.38) we obtain the following equation:
that can be supported by the mass-transfer functions of the
reactor is:
kla (C7~ - c~)=qoX.
kLa C~
(9.39)
Xmax --
qo
(9.40)
k La is used to characterise the oxygen mass-transfer capability
of fermenters. If kLa for a particular system is small, the ability
of the reactor to deliver oxygen to the cells is limited. We can
predict the response of the fermenter to changes in mass-
transfer operating conditions using Eq. (9.39). For example
if the rate of cell metabolism remains unchanged but kLa
is increased, e.g. by raising the stirrer speed to reduce the thick-
ness of the boundary layer around the bubbles, the
dissolved-oxygen concentration CAL must rise in order for the
left-hand side of Eq. (9.39) to remain equal to the right-hand
side. Similarly, if the rate of oxygen consumption by the cells
accelerates while kLa is unaffected, CAL must decrease.
We can use Eq. (9.39) to deduce some important relation-
ships for fermenters. First, let us estimate the maximum cell
concentration that can be supported by the fermenter's oxy-
gen-transfer system. For a given set of operating conditions,
the maximum rate of oxygen transfer occurs when the concen-
tration-difference driving force (C~ L - CAL) is highest, i.e.
when the concentration of dissolved oxygen CAL is zero.
Therefore from Eq. (9.39), the maximum cell concentration
If Xma~ estimated using Eq. (9.40) is lower than the cell con-
centration required in the fermentation process, kLa must be
improved. It is generally undesirable for cell density to be
limited by rate of mass transfer. Comparison of Xmax values
evaluated using Eqs (8.52) and (9.40) can be used to gauge the
relative effectiveness of heat and mass transfer in aerobic fer-
mentation. For example, if Xmax from Eq. (9.40) were small
while Xmax calculated from heat-transfer considerations were
large, we would know that mass-transfer operations are more
likely to limit biomass growth. If both Xm~x values are greater
than that desired for the process, heat and mass transfer are
adequate.
Another important parameter is the minimum kLa
required to maintain CaL > Ccrit in the fermenter. This can be
determined from Eq. (9.39) as:
qo x
(kLa)crit =
(C~t L - Ccrit )
(9.41)
Example 9.1 Cell concentration in aerobic culture
A strain of Azotobacter vinelandii is cultured in a 15 m 3 stirred fermenter for alginate production. Under current operating
conditions kLa is 0.17 s- 1. Oxygen solubility in the broth is approximately 8 x 10 -3 kg m -3.
(a) The specific rate of oxygen uptake is 12.5 mmol g-1 h - 1 . What is the maximum possible cell concentration?
(b) The bacteria suffer growth inhibition after copper sulphate is accidently added to the fermentation broth. This causes a reduc-
tion in oxygen uptake rate to 3 mmol g- 1 h - 1. What maximum cell concentration can now be supported by the fermenter?
Solution:
(a) From Eq. (9.40):

increased to:
Xmax= 4.167 (12 gl-1) = 50 g1-1.
To achieve the calculated cell densities all other conditions must be favourable, e.g. sufficient substrate and time must be provided.9 Mass Transfer
9.6 Oxygen Transfer in Fermenters
The rate of oxygen transfer in fermentation broths is influ-
enced by several physical and chemical factors that change
either the value of k L or the value of a, or the driving force for
mass transfer, (C~L -- CAL). As a general rule of thumb, k L in
fermentation liquids is about 3-4 • 10 -4 m s-] for bubbles
greater than 2-3 mm diameter; this can be reduced to
1 • 1 0 - 4 m s -] for smaller bubbles depending on bubble
rigidity. Once the bubbles are above 2-3 mm in size, k L is rela-
tively constant and insensitive to conditions. If substantial
improvement in mass-transfer rates is required, it is usually
more productive to focus on increasing the interfacial area a.
Operating values in bioreactors for the combined coefficient
kLa span a wide range over about three orders of magnitude;
this is due mainly to the large variation in a. In production-
scale fermenters, the value of kLa is typically in the range
0.02 s- l to 0.25 s-I.
In this section, several aspects of fermenter design and
operation are discussed in terms of their effect on oxygen mass
transfer.
9.6.1 Bubbles
The efficiency of gas-liquid mass transfer depends to a large
extent on the characteristics of bubbles in the liquid medium.
Bubble behaviour strongly affects the value of kLa; some prop-
erties of bubbles affect mainly the magnitude of k L, whereas
others change the interfacial area a. The important aspects of
bubble behaviour in fermenters are described below.
Stirred fermenters are used most commonly for aerobic cul-
ture. In these vessels, oxygen is supplied to the medium by
sparging swarms of air bubbles underneath the impeller. The
action of the impeller then creates a dispersion of gas through-
out the veSsel. In small laboratory-scale fermenters all of the
liquid is close to the impeller; bubbles in these systems are fre-
quently subjected to severe distortions as they interact with
turbulent liquid currents in the vessel. In contrast, bubbles in
most industrial stirred tanks spend a large proportion of their
time floating free and unimpeded through the liquid after
initial dispersion at the impeller. Liquid in large fermenters
away from the impeller does not possess sufficient energy for
continuous break-up of bubbles. This is a consequence of
scale; most laboratory fermenters operate with stirrer power
between 10 and 20 kW m -3, whereas large agitated vessels
operate at 0.5-5 kW m -3. The result is that virtually all large
commercial-size stirred-tank reactors operate mostly in the
free bubble-rise regime [8].
The most important property of air bubbles in fermenters is
2,02,
their size. For a given volume of gas, more interfacial area a is
provided if the gas is dispersed into many small bubbles rather
than a few large ones; therefore a major goal in bioreactor
design is a high level of gas dispersion. However, there are
other important benefits associated with small bubbles. Small
bubbles have correspondingly slow bubble-rise velocities; con-
sequently they stay in the liquid longer, allowing more time for
the oxygen to dissolve. Small bubbles therefore create high gas
hold-up, defined as the fraction of the fluid volume in the reac-
tor occupied by gas:
C =
vc
v, + vc
(9.42)
where e is the gas hold-up, VG is the volume of gas bubbles in
the reactor, and VL is the volume of liquid. Because the total
interfacial area for oxygen transfer depends on the total vol-
ume of gas in the system as well as on the average bubble size,
high mass-transfer rates are achieved at high gas hold-ups. Gas
hold-up values are very difficult to predict and may be
anything from very low (0.01) up to a maximum in commer-
cial-scale stirred fermenters of about 0.2. Under normal
operating conditions, a significant fraction of the oxygen in
fermentation vessels in contained in the gas hold-up. For
example if the culture is sparged with air and the broth satur-
ated with dissolved oxygen, for an air hold-up of only 0.03,
about half the total oxygen in the system is in the gas phase.
While it is desirable to have small bubbles, there are practi-
cal limits. Bubbles << 1 mm diameter can become a nuisance
in bioreactors. Oxygen concentration in these bubbles equili-
brates with that in the medium within seconds, so that the gas
hold-up no longer reflects the capacity of the system for mass
transfer [9]. Problems with very small bubbles are exacerbated
in viscous non-Newtonian broths; tiny bubbles remain lodged
in these fluids for long periods of time because their velocity of
rise is reduced. As a rule of thumb, relatively large bubbles
must be employed in viscous cultures.
Bubble size also affects the value of k L. In most fermenta-
tion broths, if the bubbles have diameters less than 2-3 ram,
surface tension effects dominate the behaviour of the bubble
surface. As a result, the bubbles behave as rigid spheres with
immobile surfaces and no internal gas circulation. A rigid
bubble surface gives lower k L values; k L decreases with
decreasing bubble diameter below 2-3 ram. On the other
hand, bubbles in fermentation media with sizes greater than
about 3 mm develop internal circulation and relatively mobile
surfaces, depending on liquid properties. Bubbles with mobile
surfaces are able to wobble and move in spirals during free rise;9 Mass Transfer

this behaviour has a marked beneficial effect on k L and rate of
mass transfer.
To summarise the influence of bubble size on oxygen mass
transfer, small bubbles are generally beneficial because of the
increased gas hold-up and larger interfacial surface-area.
However, k L for bubbles less than about 3 mm diameter is
reduced due to surface effects. Very small bubbles << 1 mm
should be avoided, especially in viscous broth.
9.6.2
Sparging, Stirring and Medium
Properties
Because bubble size is such a critical parameter affecting oxy-
gen transfer, it is useful to consider the physical processes in
fermenters which determine bubble size. These processes
include bubble formation, gas dispersion and coalescence.
Air bubbles are formed at the sparger. There exists a large
variety of sparger designs, including simple open pipes, perfor-
ated tubes, porous diffusers, and complex two-phase injector
devices. Bubbles leaving the sparger usually fall within a rela-
tively narrow size range depending on the sparger type. This
size range is a significant parameter in design of air-driven fer-
menters such as bubble and airlift columns because there is no
other mechanism for bubble dispersion in these reactors.
However in stirred vessels, design of the sparger and the mechan-
ics of bubble formation are of secondary importance compared
with the effects of the impeller. As a result of contin-
ual bubble break-up and dispersion by the impeller and coales-
cence from bubble collisions, bubble sizes in stirred reactors
often bear little relationship to those formed at the sparger.
Coalescence of small bubbles into bigger bubbles is generally
undesirable because it reduces the total interfacial area and gas
hold-up. Frequency of coalescence depends mainly on the liquid
properties. In a coalescing liquid, a large fraction of bubble colli-
sions results in the formation of bigger bubbles, while in
non-coalescing liquids colliding bubbles do not coalesce readily.
Salts act to suppress coalescence; therefore, fermentation media
are usually non-coalescing to some extent depending on com-
position. This is an advantage for oxygen mass transfer.
Flow patterns set up in stirred vessels in the absence of aera-
tion have been described in Chapter 7. As illustrated in Figure
9.9, when air is sparged different gas flow patterns develop
depending on the relative rates of gas input and stirring. As
shown in Figure 9.9(a), if the agitator speed N i is low and the
gas feed rate Fg is high, gas envelopes the impeller without dis-
persion and the flow pattern is dominated by air flow up the
stirrer shaft. Impeller flooding is said to occur; this means that
the gas-handling capacity of the stirrer is smaller than the
amount introduced. Flooding should be avoided because an
impeller surrounded by gas no longer contacts the liquid prop-
erly, resulting in poor mixing and gas dispersion. As the
impeller speed increases, gas is captured behind the agitator
blades and is dispersed into the liquid. NiB is the minimum
stirrer speed required to just completely disperse the gas,2,04

including below the impeller. The minimum agitator tip
speed for dispersion of air bubbles even at very low gas flow
rates has been estimated by Westerterp et aL [10] as roughly
1.5-2.5 m s-I; tip speed = g N i D i where N i is impeller speed
and D i is impeller diameter. With further increases in stirrer
speed, small recirculation patterns start to emerge as indicated
in Figure 9.9(e); NiR is the speed at which gross recirculation
of gas back to the agitator starts to occur.
Gas dispersion in stirred vessels takes place mainly in the
immediate vicinity of the impeller. As shown in Figure 7.27
(see p. 154), when gas is present in stirred liquids it is drawn
into low-pressure cavities behind the stirrer blades. Gas from
the sparger together with a large fraction of the recirculating
gas in the system is entrained in these cavities. Gas contacting
the impeller blades leads to a decrease in the friction or drag
coefficient associated with impeller rotation and a concomi-
tant reduction in power consumption. As the impeller blades
rotate at high speed, small gas bubbles are thrown out from the
back of the cavities into the bulk liquid under the influence of
dispersion processes that are not yet completely understood.
In a non-coalescing liquid, the bubbles remain close to the size
produced at the back of the cavities. Because bubbles formed
at the sparger are immediately drawn into the impeller zone,
dispersion of gas in stirred vessels is largely independent of
sparger design; when the sparger is located under the stirrer, it
has been shown that sparger type does not significantly affect
mass transfer.
Under typical fermenter operating conditions, increasing
the stirrer speed improves the value of kLa, as shown in Figure
9.10. In contrast, except at very low sparging rates, increasing
the gas flow is generally considered to exert only a minor influ-
ence on kLa. As indicated in Figure 9.11, increasing the
number of impellers on the stirrer shaft does not necessarily
improve kLa even though the power consumption is
increased. The quantity of gas passing through the upper
impellers is small compared with the lower impeller, so that
any additional gas dispersion is not significant.
9.6.3
Antifoam
Agents
Most cell cultures produce a variety of foam-producing and
foam-stabilising agents, such as proteins, polysaccharides and
fatty acids. Foam build-up in fermenters is very common,9 Mass Transfer
particularly in aerobic systems. Foaming causes a range of reac-
tor operating problems; foam control is therefore an
important consideration in fermentation design. Excessive
foam overflowing from the top of the fermenter provides a
route for entry of contaminating organisms and causes block-
age of outlet gas lines. Liquid and cells trapped in the foam
represent a loss of bioreactor volume; conditions in the foam
may not be favourable for metabolic activity. In addition,
fragile cells can be damaged by collapsing foam.
Addition of special antifoam compounds to the medium is
the most common method of reducing foam build-up in fer-
menters. However, antifoam compounds affect the surface
chemistry of bubbles and their tendency to coalesce, and have
a significant effect on kLa. Most antifoam agents are strong
surface tension-lowering substances. Decrease in surface ten-
sion reduces the average bubble diameter, thus producing
higher values of a. However, this is countered by a reduction
in mobility of the gas-liquid interface which lowers the value
of k L. With most silicon-based antifoams, the decrease in k L is
generally larger than the increase in a so that, overall, kLa is
reduced [11, 12]. The resulting decrease in rate of oxygen
transfer can be dramatic, by up to a factor of 10.
In order to maintain the non-coalescing character of the
medium and high kLa values, mechanical rather than chemi-
cal methods of disrupting foam are preferred because the
liquid properties are not changed. Mechanical foam breakers,
such as high-speed discs rotating at the top of the vessel and
centrifugal foam destroyers, are suitable when foam develop-
ment is moderate. However, some of these devices need large
quantities of power to operate in commercial-scale vessels;
their limited foam-destroying capacity is also a problem with
highly-foaming cultures. In many cases, use of chemical anti-
foam agents is unavoidable.
9.6.4 Temperature
The temperature of aerobic fermentations affects both the sol-
ubility of oxygen C~L and the mass-transfer coefficient k L.
Increasing temperature causes C~L to drop, so that the driving
force for mass transfer (C~ L - CAL) is reduced. At the same
time, diffusivity of oxygen in the liquid film surrounding the
bubbles is increased, resulting in an increase in k L. The net
effect of temperature on oxygen transfer depends on the range
of temperature considered. For temperatures between 10~
and 40~ increase in temperature is more likely to increase
the rate of oxygen transfer. Above 40~ the solubility of oxy-
gen drops significantly, adversely affecting the driving force
and rate of mass transfer.
2,o~
9.6.5 Gas Pressure and Oxygen Partial
Pressure
Pressure and oxygen partial pressure of the gas used to aerate
fermenters affect the value of C~ L. The equilibrium relation-
ship between these parameters for dilute liquid solutions is
given by Henry'slaw:
PAG = PT YAG = H C~.I~
(9.43)
where PAG is the partial pressure of component A in the gas, PT
is total gas pressure, YAGis the mole fraction of A in the gas, H
is Henry's constant which is a function of temperature, and
C~L is the solubility of component A in the liquid. From Eq.
(9.43), if the total gas pressure PT or concentration of oxygen
in the gas YAG is increased at constant temperature, C~ L and
therefore the mass-transfer driving force (C~ L - CAL) also
increase.
In some fermentations, oxygen-enriched air or pure oxygen
is used to improve mass transfer. Alternatively, oxygen solubil-
ity is increased by sparging compressed air at high pressure.
Both these strategies increase the operating cost of the fer-
menter; it is also possible in some cases that the culture will
suffer inhibitory effects from exposure to very high oxygen
partial pressures.
9.6.6 Presence of Cells
Oxygen transfer is influenced by the presence of cells in fer-
mentation broths; the nature of the effect depends on the
species of organism, its morphology and concentration. Cells
with complex morphology generally lead to lower transfer
rates. Cells interfere with bubble break-up and coalescence;
cells, proteins and other molecules which adsorb at gas-liquid
interfaces also cause inte~acial blanketing which reduces the
contact area between gas and liquid. The quantitative effect of
interfacial blanketing is highly system-specific. Because con-
centrations of cells, substrates and products change
throughout batch fermentation, the value of kLa can also vary.
An example of change in kLa due to these factors is shown in
Figure 9.12.

normally measured using a dissolved-oxygenelectrode.There are

of these probes can be found in other references [13, 14]. In
both designs, a membrane which is permeable to oxygen sep-
arates the fermentation fluid from the electrode. As illustrated
in Figure 9.13, oxygen diffuses through the membrane to the
cathode, where it reacts to produce a current between anode
and cathode proportional to the oxygen partial pressure in the
fermentation broth. An electrolyte solution in the electrode
supplies ions which take part in the reactions, and must be
replenished at regular intervals. Depending on flow conditions
in the bulk medium, liquid properties, and the rate of oxygen
utilisation by the probe, a liquid boundary layer develops at
the interface between the solid probe and the liquid.
As indicated in Figure 9.13, supply of oxygen molecules
from the bulk medium to the cathode is in itself a mass-trans-
fer process. Because there is no bulk fluid motion in the
membrane or electrolyte solution and little motion in the
liquid film at the membrane interface, operation of the probe
relies on diffusion of oxygen across these thicknesses. This
takes time, so the response of an electrode to sudden changes
in dissolved-oxygen level is subject to delay. The electrode
response time can be measured by quickly transferring the
probe from a beaker containing medium saturated with nitro-
gen to one saturated with air. The response time is defined as
the time taken for the probe to indicate 63% of the total
change in dissolved-oxygen level. For commercially-available
steam-sterilisable electrodes, response times are usually
10-100 s. Electrode response can usually be improved if
the bulk liquid is stirred rapidly; this decreases the thickness of
the liquid film at the membrane surface. Micro-probes for
dissolved-oxygen measurement are also available. The smaller
cathode size and lower rate of oxygen consumption by these

instruments means that their response is quicker; so much so
that micro-probes can be used to measure dissolved oxygen
levels in unagitated systems. Steam-sterilisable probes are
inserted directly into fermentation vessels for on-line moni-
toring of dissolved oxygen. Repeated calibration of dissolved-
oxygen probes is usually necessary; fouling by cells attaching to
the membrane surface, electronic noise due to air bubbles
passing close to the membrane, and signal drift are the main
operating problems.
Both galvanic and polarographic electrodes measure the
partial pressure of dissolved oxygen or oxygen tension in the fer-
mentation broth, not the dissolved-oxygen concentration. To
convert this to dissolved-oxygen concentration, it is necessary
to know the solubility of oxygen in the liquid at the tempera-
ture and pressure of measurement.
9.8 Estimating Oxygen Solubility
The concentration difference (C~L -- CAL) is the driving
force for oxygen mass transfer. Because this difference is usu-
ally very small, it is important that the solubility C~L be
known accurately; small errors in C~L will result to large
errors in (C~L -- CAL). Experimentally-determined values
for solubility of oxygen in water can be found in many litera-
ture sources, e.g. [15-17]; Table 9.1 shows the solubility of
oxygen in water under 1 atm oxygen pressure at various tem-
peratures. However, fermentations are not carried out using
pure water and pure oxygen. Because oxygen partial pressure
in the gas phase and presence of dissolved material in the
liquid are major factors affecting oxygen solubility, the values
given in Table 9.1 cannot be applied directly to bioprocessing
systems.9 Mass Transfer

Effect of Oxygen Partial Pressure
According to the International Critical Tables [18], the mole
fraction of oxygen in air is 0.2099, so the partial pressure of
oxygen at I atm air pressure is 0.2099 atm. At a given tempera-
ture, the effect of gas-phase oxygen partial pressure on
solubility is given by Henry's law, Eq. (9.43). Therefore, the
solubility of oxygen in water under I atm air pressure is 0.2099

in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 for water in the range 0-40~ SolubilEy

Effect of Solutes
Presence of solutes such as salts, acids and sugars has a signific-
ant effect on oxygen solubility in water, as indicated in Tables
9.3 and 9.4. These data indicate that oxygen solubility is
decreased by the ions and sugars normally added to fermenta-
tion media. The effect on oxygen solubility of ionic and
non-ionic solutes such as molasses, corn-steep liquor, protein
and antifoam agents is reported in several publications
[ 19-24]. Quicker et al. [23] have developed an empirical cor-
relation to correct values of oxygen solubility in water for the
effects of cations, anions and sugars:9 Mass Transfer

In general, there are two approaches to evaluating k L and a:
calculation using empirical correlations, and experimental
measurement. In both cases, separate determination of k L and
a is laborious and sometimes impossible. It is convenient
therefore to directly evaluate the product kLa; the combined
term kLa is often referred to as the mass-transfer coefficient
rather than just k L. In this section we consider methods for cal-
culating kLa using published correlations.
In aerobic fermenters, kL and a are dependent on the hydro-
dynamic conditions around the gas bubbles. Relationships
between kLa and parameters such as bubble diameter, liquid
velocity, density, viscosity and oxygen diffusivity have been
investigated extensively, and empirical correlations between9 Mass Transfer

mass-transfer coefficients and important operating variables
have been developed. Theoretically, these correlations allow
prediction of mass-transfer coefficients based on information
gathered from a large number of previous experiments. In prac-
tice, however, the accuracy of published correlations applied to
biological systems is generally poor. The main reason is that
mass transfer is strongly affected by the additives usually
present in fermentation media. Because fermentation liquids
contain varying levels of substrates, products, salts, surface-
active agents and cells, the surface chemistry of bubbles and
therefore the mass-transfer situation become very complex.
Most available correlations for oxygen mass-transfer coeffi-
cients were determined using pure air in water, and it is very
difficult to correct these correlations for different liquid com-
positions. The effective mass-transfer area a is also influenced
by interfacial blanketing of the bubble-liquid surface by cells
and other components of the broth. Prediction of kLa under
these conditions is problematic.
When mass-transfer coefficients are required for large-scale
equipment, another factor related to hydrodynamic condi-
tions limits the applicability of published correlations. Most
studies of oxygen mass-transfer have been carried out in labor-
atory-scale stirred reactors, which are characterised by high
turbulence throughout most of the vessel. The gas phase in
small-scale agitated tanks is well dispersed; break-up and
coalescence of bubbles occur constantly due to the high level
of turbulence and frequent bubble collisions. In contrast,
bubbles in industrial-scale stirred tanks are mostly in free rise.
The result is that, due to the different hydrodynamic regimes
present in small- and large-scale vessels, mass-transfer correla-
tions for stirred tanks developed in the laboratory tend to
overestimate the oxygen-transfer capacity of commercial-scale
systems. Better results can be achieved with a two-compart-
ment model of large fermenters, applying different
correlations for the mixed zone close to the impeller and the
bubble zone away from the impeller. Application of this tech-
nique for calculation of oxygen transfer-rate is described by
Oosterhuis and Kossen [25].
In this section we will consider one empirical correlation
for oxygen mass transfer; its application in fermentation
systems is subject to the problems mentioned above. A widely-
used correlation for stirred vessels relates kLa directly to gas
velocity and power input to the stirrer; all the effects of flow
and turbulence on bubble dispersion and the mass-transfer
boundary layer are represented by the power term. An expres-
sion for stirred fermenters containing non-coalescing
non-viscous media is [26]:

m-3.
Experimental results for kLa are reported to agree with Eq.
(9.46) to within 20-40%; however application of this correla-
tion to production-size vessels up to 25 m 3 in volume has been
found to overestimate rate of oxygen transfer by about 100%
[25]. Note that this correlation does not depend on the sparger
or stirrer design; the power dissipated by the impeller deter-
mines kLa independent of stirrer type. Like most published
correlations, Eq. (9.46) does not take into account the non-
Newtonian behaviour of many culture fluids, the effect of
added sugars and antifoam agents, and the presence of solids
such as cells.
Eq. (9.46) suggests that kLa can be increased by raising the
superficial gas velocity in the reactor. However, the exponent
on uG in Eq. (9.46) is much less than unity, so the effect of gas
flow rate is relatively minor. There is usually limited scope for
increasing uG depending on vessel configuration; at high uG
the liquid contents can be blown out of the fermenter. The
maximum operating value for uG also depends on the stirrer
speed; as discussed in Section 9.6.2, unless the impeller is able
to disperse all the air impinging on it, impeller flooding will
occur. Because the exponent on Pin Eq. (9.46) is also less than
one, increasing kLa by raising either the air flow rate or power
input becomes progressively less efficient and more costly as
the inputs increase.
9 . 1 0 M e a s u r e m e n t o f kLa
Because of the difficulty in predicting kLa in bioreactors using
correlations, mass-transfer coefficients for oxygen are usually
determined experimentally. This is not without its own prob-
lems however, as discussed below. Whatever method is used to
measure kLa, the measurement conditions should match those
in the fermenter during normal operation. Techniques for
measuring kLa have been reviewed by van't Riet [26].
9.10.1
Oxygen-Balance
Method
This technique is based on the equation for gas-liquid mass
transfer, Eq. (9.37). In the experiment, the oxygen content of
gas streams flowing to and from the fermenter are measured.
From a mass balance at steady state, the difference in oxygen
flow between inlet and outlet must be equal to the rate of oxy-
gen transfer from gas to liquid:
1
(9.47)
where VL is the volume of liquid in the fermenter, Fg is the vol-
umetric gas flow rate, CAG is the gas-phase concentration of
oxygen, and subscripts i and o refer to inlet and outlet gas
streams, respectively. The first term on the right-hand side of
Eq. (9.47) represents the rate at which oxygen enters the fer-
menter in the inlet-gas stream; the second term is the rate at
which oxygen leaves. The difference between them is the rate at
which oxygen is transferred out of the gas into the liquid, N A.
Because gas concentrations are generally measured as partial
pressures, the ideal gas law Eq. (2.32) can be incorporated into
Eq. (9.47) to obtain an alternative expression:
(9.48)
where R is the universal gas constant (see Table 2.5 on p. 20),
PAG is the oxygen partial pressure in the gas and Tis absolute
temperature. Because oxygen partial pressures in the inlet and
exit gas streams are usually not very different during operation
of fermenters, they must be measured very accurately, e.g.
using mass spectrometry. The temperature and flow rate of the
gases must also be measured carefully to ensure an accurate
value of N a is determined. Once N A is known and CAL and
C~,L found using the methods described in Sections 9.7 and
9.8, kLa can be calculated from Eq. (9.37).
The steady-state oxygen-balance method is the most reli-
able procedure for measuring kLa, and allows determination
from a single-point measurement. An important advantage is
that the method can be applied to fermenters during normal
operation. It depends, however, on accurate measurement of
gas composition, flow rate, pressure and temperature; large
errors as high as + 100% can be introduced if measurement
techniques are inadequate. Considerations for design of labor-
atory equipment to ensure accurate oxygen uptake
measurements are described by Brooks et al. [27].
9.10.2 Dynamic Method
This method for measuring kLa is based on an unsteady-state
mass balance for oxygen. The main advantage of the dynamic9 Mass Transfer

A 20-1 stirred fermenter containing a Bacillusthuringiensisculture at 30~ is used for production of microbial insecticide, kLa is

is then re-connected. When steady state is established, the dissolved-oxygen tension is 78% air saturation. The following results
are obtained.

Solution:

The error in kLa is almost 100%. This example illustrates how important it is to obtain accurate data for kLa determination.
An oxygen probe with fast response time is required for
measurement of C~L, otherwise the dynamic method will not
give accurate results. Frequently, however, the response time of
the electrode is similar in magnitude to the time for mass trans-
fer. When this is the case, values of CAL measured during the
experiment do not reflect the instantaneous oxygen concentra-
tion. Electrode response time should always be measured in
conjunction with the dynamic method for kLa determination.
In principle, the probe response time (Section 9.7) should be
much smaller than the mass-transfer response time, 1/kLa.
Van't Riet [26] has estimated that acceptable results are
obtained using commercial electrodes with response times
between 2 and 3 s for kLa values up to 0.1 s -1. When the
response time is closer to 1/kLa, the measurements should be
corrected for electrode dynamics. Further discussion and analy-
sis of this problem can be found in the literature [26, 28-34].
Another factor affecting accuracy of the dynamic method is
the average residence time of gas in the system when de-
oxygenation with nitrogen is followed by a switch to aeration
at the beginning of the measurement. Because there is a nitro-
gen gas hold-up in the vessel when air is re-introduced,
measurement of CAt- does not reflect the kinetics of simple
oxygen transfer until a hold-up of air is established. This takes
longer in large vessels; dynamic methods for kLa measurement
are therefore restricted to vessels with height less than 1 m
[35]. Dynamic methods are inappropriate for viscous broths
for similar reasons; the large residence times of bubbles in vis-
cous broths affect the accuracy of measurement [9].
Corrections to account for gas-phase dynamics in small vessels
are described by Dunn and Einsele [29] and Dang et al. [32].
When the gas velocity is low and the hold-up high, such large
corrections are required that the original measurements
become meaningless.
9.10.3 Sulphite O x i d a t i o n
This method is based on oxidation of sodium sulphite to sul-
phate in the presence of a catalyst such as Cu 2+. Although the
sulphite method has been used extensively, the results appear
to depend on operating conditions in an unknown way, and
usually give higher kLa values than other techniques.
Accordingly, its application is discouraged [26].
9.11 Oxygen Transfer in Large Vessels
Special difficulties are associated with measurement of oxygen
transfer in large fermenters. Problems of residual gas hold-up
with the dynamic method have already been mentioned.
Implicit in application of the experimental techniques
described in Section 9.10 is the assumption that kLa is con-
stant throughout the entire reactor. This requires that the gas
and liquid phases be perfectly mixed with uniform turbulence.
In commercial-size reactors (> 10 m3), perfect mixing is diffi-
cult to achieve; as a result the calculated value of kLa may
depend on the position in the tank where the measurements of
CALare made. Even when mixing is good, variation in compo-
sition of the gas phase is inevitable as changing static pressure
and continuing dissolution of oxygen reduce the oxygen par-
tial pressure in the bubbles as they rise.
Significant variation between inlet and outlet oxygen par-
tial pressures affects the value for C~ L used in mass-transfer
calculations. Allowance can be made for this by determining
an average concentration driving force (C~ L - CAL) across
the system. A suitable average is the logarithmic-mean concen-
tration difference, ( C~L -- CAL)L:

the vessel at a rate of 1 vvm; (vvm stands for volume of gas per
volume of liquid per minute). The average pressure in the fer-
menter is 1 atm. The volumetric flow rate of off-gas from the
fermenter is measured as 189 1 min-1. The exit gas stream is
analysed for oxygen and is found to contain 20.1% 0 2. The
dissolved-oxygen concentration in the broth is measured using
an oxygen electrode as 52% air saturation. The solubility of
oxygen in the fermentation broth at 28~ and 1 atm air press-
ure is 7.8 x 10-3 kg m-3.

Unit Operations
Bioprocesses treat raw materials and generate useful products. Individual operations or steps within the process that change or
separate components are called unit operations. Although the specific objectives of bioprocesses varyfkom factory to factory,
each processing scheme can be viewed as a series of component operations which appear again and again in different systems.
For example, most bioprocesses involve one or more of the following unit operations: centrifugation, chromatography, cooling,
crystallisation, dialysis, distillation, drying, evaporation, filtration, heating, humidification, membrane separation, milling,
mixing, precipitation, solids handling, solvent extraction. A particular sequence of unit operations usedfor manufacture of
enzymes is shown in the flow sheet of Figure 10.1. Although the same operations are involved in otherprocesses, the order in
which they are carried out, the conditions used and the actual materials handled account for the differences in flnal results.
Engineeringprinciples for design of unit operations are independent of specific industries or applications.
In a typical fermentation process, raw materials are altered
most significantly by reactions occurring in the fermenter.
However physical changes before and after fermentation are
also important to prepare the substrates for reaction and to
extract and purify the desired product from the culture broth.
The term 'unit operation' usually refers to the physical steps in
processes; chemical or biochemical transformations are the
subject of reaction engineering which is considered in detail in
Chapters 11-13.
Fermentation broths are complex mixtures of components
containing products in dilute solution. In bioprocessing, any
treatment of the culture broth after fermentation is known as
downstream processing. The purpose of downstream processing
is to concentrate and purify the product for sale; in most cases
this requires only physical modification. Although each recov-
ery scheme will be different, downstream processing follows a
general sequence of steps.
(i)
Cell removal. A common first step in product recovery is
removal of cells from the fermentation liquor. This is
necessary if the biomass itself is the desired product, e.g.
bakers' yeast, or if the product is contained within the
cells. Removal of cells can also assist recovery of product
from the liquid phase. Filtration and centrifugation are
typical unit operations for cell removal.
(ii) Primary isolation. A wide variety of techniques is available
for primary isolation of fermentation products from cells
or cell-free broth. The method used'depends on the phys-
ical and chemical properties of the product and
surrounding material. The aim of primary isolation is to
remove components with properties significantly differ-
ent from those of the product. Typically, processes for
primary isolation treat large volumes of material and are
relatively non-selective; however significant increases in
product quality and concentration can be accomplished.
Unit operations such as adsorption, liquid extraction and
precipitation are used for primary isolation.
(iii) Purification. Processes for purification are highlyselective
and separate the product from impurities with similar
properties. Typical unit operations are chromatography,
ultrafiltration and fractional precipitation.
(iv) Final isolation. The final purity required depends on the
product application. Crystallisation, followed by centri-
fugation or filtration and drying, are typical operations
used for high-quality products such as pharmaceuticals.
A typical profile of product quality through the various stages
of downstream processing is given in Table 10.1.
Downstream processing can account for a substantial part of
the total production cost of a fermentation product. For
example, the ratio of fermentation cost to cost of product
recovery is approximately 60:40 for antibiotics such as penicil-
lin. For newer antibiotics this ratio is reversed; product
recovery is more costly than fermentation. Many modern
products of biotechnology such as recombinant proteins and
monoclonal antibodies require expensive downstream process-
ing which accounts for 80-90% of process costs [1]. Starting
product levels before recovery have a strong influence on cost;TOUnit Operations

purification is more expensive when the concentration of
product in the biomass or fermentation broth is low. As illus-
trated in Figure 10.2, the higher the starting concentration the"
cheaper is the final product. Each downstream-processing step
involves some product loss; these losses can be substantial for
multi-step procedures. For example, if 80% of the product is
retained at each purification step, after a five-step process the
overall product recovery is only about one-third. If the starting
concentration is very low, more recovery stages are required
with higher attendant losses and costs. This situation can be
improved by either enhancing product synthesis during fer-
mentation or developing better downstream-processing
techniques which minimise product loss.
There is an extensive literature on downstream processing,
much of it dealing with recent advances. To thoroughly cover all
unit operations used in bioprocessing is beyond the scope of this
book; at least one entire separate volume would be required.
Rather than attempt such a treatise, this chapter considers thezo Unit Operations

10.1
Filtration
In filtration, solid particles are separated from a fluid-solid
mixture by forcing the fluid through a filter medium or filter
cloth which retains the particles. Solids are deposited on the fil-
ter and, as the deposit or filter cake increases in depth, pose a
resistance to further filtration. Filtration can be performed
using either vacuum or positive-pressure equipment. The
pressure difference exerted across the filter to separate fluid
from the solids is called the filtration pressure drop.
Ease of filtration depends on the properties of the solid and
fluid; filtration of crystalline, incompressible solids in low-
viscosity liquids is relatively straightforward. In contrast,
fermentation broths can be difficult to filter because of the
small size and gelatinous nature of the cells and the viscous
non-Newtonian behaviour of the broth. Most microbial filter
cakes are compressible, i.e. the porosity of the cake declines as
pressure drop across the filter increases. This can be a major
problem causing reduced filtration rates and greater loss of
product. Filtration of fermentation broths is usually carried
out under non-aseptic conditions; the process must therefore
be efficient and reliable to avoid undue contamination and
degradation of labile products.

filtration. Diatomaceous earth, also known as kieselguhr, is
the fused skeletal remains of diatoms. Packed beds of granu-
lated kieselguhr have very high porosity; only about 15% of
the total volume of packed kieselguhr is solid, the rest is
empty space. Such high porosity facilitates liquid flow
around the particles and improves rate of filtration through
the bed.
Filter aids are applied in two ways. As shown in Figure
10.3, filter aid can be used as a pre-coat on the filter medium to
prevent blockage or 'blinding' of the filter by solids which
would otherwise wedge themselves into the pores of the cloth.
Filter aid can also be added to the fermentation broth to
increase the porosity of the cake as it forms. This is only rec-
ommended when the fermentation product is extracellular;
for intracellular products requiring further processing of the
cells, severe handling problems can arise if the cake is contami-
nated with filter aid. Filter aid adds to the cost of filtration; the
minimum quantity needed to achieve the desired result must
be established experimentally. Kieselguhr absorbs liquid;
therefore, if the fermentation product is in the liquid phase,
some will be lost. Another disadvantage is that as filtration rate
increases with the assistance of filter aid, filtrate clarity is
reduced. Disposal of waste cell material is more difficult if it
contains kieselguhr; for example, biomass cannot be used as
animal feed unless the filter aid is removed.
Fermentation broths can be pre-treated to improve filtra-
tion characteristics. Heating to denature proteins enhances the
filterability ofmycelial broths such as in penicillin production.
Alternatively, electrolytes may be added to promote coagula-
tion of colloids into larger, denser particles which are easier to
filter. Ease of filtration is also affected by the duration of the
fermentation; this affects the composition and viscosity of the
medium and properties of the cell cake.IO Unit Operations

Filter
cloth
Plate filters are suitable for filtration of small fermentation
batches; this type of filter gradually accumulates biomass and
must be periodically opened and cleared of filter cake. Larger
processes require continuous filters. Rotary-drum vacuum fil-
ters, such as that shown in Figure 10.4, are the most
widely-used filtration devices in the fermentation industry. A
horizontal drum 0.5-3 m in diameter is covered with filter
cloth and rotated slowly at 0.1-2 rpm. The cloth is partially
immersed in an agitated reservoir containing material to be fil-
tered. As a section of drum enters the liquid, a vacuum is
applied from the interior of the drum. A cake forms on the face
of the cloth while liquid is drawn through internal pipes to a
collection tank. As the drum rotates out of the reservoir, the
surface of the filter is sprayed with wash liquid which is drawn
through the cloth and collected in a separate holding tank.
After washing, the cake is dewatered by continued application
of the vacuum. The vacuum is turned off as the drum reaches
the discharge zone where the cake is removed by means of a
scraper, knife or strings. Air pressure may be applied at thisIO Unit Operations

10.1.3
Filtration Theory
Filtration theory is used to estimate rate of filtration. For a given
pressure drop across the filter, rate of filtration is greatest just as
filtering begins. This is because resistance to filtration is at a
minimum when there are no deposited solids. Orientation of
particles in the initial cake deposit is very important and can sig-
nificantly influence the structure and permeability of the whole
filter bed. Excessive pressure drop and high initial rates of filtra-
tion can result in plugging of the filter cloth and very high
subsequent resistance to flow. Flow resistance due to the filter
cloth can be considered constant if particles do not penetrate the
material; resistance due to the cake increases with thickness.
Rate of filtration is usually measured as the rate at which
liquid filtrate is collected. Filtration rate depends on the area of
the filter cloth, the viscosity of the fluid, the pressure difference
across the filter, and the resistance to filtration offered by the
cloth and deposited filter cake. At any instant during filtration,
rate of filtration is given by the equation:
1dVf_Ap
Adt/tf [a ( m c ) + r m ]
(10.1)
where A is filter area, Vfis volume of filtrate, tis filtration time,
Ap is pressure drop across the filter, juf is filtrate viscosity, M c is
the total mass of solids in the cake, a is the average specific cake
resistance and rm is the filter medium resistance, rm includes the
effect of the filter cloth and any particles wedged in it during
the initial stages of filtration, a has dimensions LM- 1; rm has
dimensions L- 1. d Vf/dt is the filtrate flow rate or volumetric rate
offiltration. Area A represents the capital cost of the filter; the
bigger the area required to achieve a given filtration rate, the
larger is the equipment and related investment, a is a measure
of the resistance of the filter cake to flow; its value depends on
the shape and size of the particles, the size of the interstitial
spaces between them, and the mechanical stability of the cake.
Resistance due to the filter medium is often negligible com-
pared with cake resistance.
If the filter cake is incompressible, the specific cake resistance
a does not vary with pressure drop across the filter. However,
cakes from fermentation broths are seldom incompressible; as
these cakes compress, filtration rates decline. For a compressible
cake, a can be related empirically to Ap as follows:
a =a' (Ap)'
(10.2)
where s is cake compressibility and a' is a constant dependent
largely on the size and morphology of particles in the cake. The
value of s is zero for rigid incompressible solids; for highly
compressible material s is close to unity, a is also related to the
average properties of particles in the cake as follows:
K v a 2 (1 -- ~)
Ot -
~3pp
(10.3)
where K v is a factor depending on the shape of the particles, a is
the specific surface area of the particles, e is porosky of the cake
and pp is density of the particles, a and e are defined as follows:
a =
surface area of a single particle
volume of a single particle
(10.4)
total volume of the cake
-
volume of solids in the cake
total volume of the cake
(10.5)IO Unit Operations
~.23
For compressible cakes, both e and K v depend on filtration
pressure drop.
It is useful to consider methods for improving rate of filtra-
tion for a given batch of material. Various strategies can be
deduced from the relationship between variables in Eq. (10.1).
Increase the filter area A. When all other parameters
remain constant, rate of filtration is improved if A is
increased. However, this requires installation of larger fil-
tration equipment and greater capital cost.
(ii) Increasethe filtration pressure drop Ap. The problem with
this approach for compressible cakes is that ce increases
with Ap as indicated in Eq. (10.2); higher a results in
lower filtration rate. In practice, pressure drops are usual-
ly kept below 0.5 atm to minimise cake resistance.
Improving filtration rate by increasing the pressure drop
can only be achieved by reducing s, the compressibility of
the cake. Addition of filter aid in the broth can reduce s to
some extent.
(iii) Reduce the cake mass M c. This is achieved in continuous
rotary filtration by reducing the thickness of cake depos-
ited per revolution of the drum, and ensuring that the
scraper leaves minimal cake residue on the filter cloth.
(iv) Reduce the liquid viscosity/if. Material to be filtered is
sometimes diluted if the starting viscosity is very high.
(v) Reduce the specific cake resistance a. From Eq. (10.3), poss-
ible methods of reducing oe for compressible cakes are as
follows:
(a) Increase the porosity e. Cake porosity usually
decreases as cells are filtered. Application of filter aid
reduces this effect.
(b) Reduce the shape factor of theparticles K v. In the case"
of mycelial broths, it may be possible to change the
morphology of the cells by manipulating fermenta-
tion conditions.
(c) Reduce the specific su~TCacearea of the particles a.
Increasing the average size of the particles and mini-
mising variation in particle size reduce the value of a.
Changes in fermentation conditions and broth pre-
treatment are used to achieve these effects.

for rate of filtration becomes:

Integration of Eq. (10.1) allows us to calculate the time
required to filter a given volume of material. Before carrying
out the integration, let us substitute an expression for mass of
solids in the cake as a function of filtrate volume:
+rm]
(10.7)
A filter can be operated in two different ways. If the pressure
drop across the filter is kept constant, the filtration rate will
become progressively smaller as resistance due to the cake
increases. On the other hand, in constant-rate filtration the
flow rate is maintained by gradually increasing the pressure
drop. Filtrations are most commonly carried out at constant
pressure. When this is the case, Eq. (10.7) can be integrated
directly because Vf and t are the only variables; for a given fil-
tration device and material to be filtered, each of the remaining
parameters is constant.
It is convenient for integration to write Eq. (10.7) in its
reciprocal form:

At the beginning of filtration t= 0 and Vf= 0; this is the initial
condition for integration. Separating variables and placing

Thus, for constant-pressure filtration, Eq. (10.10) can be used
to calculate either filtrate volume Vf or filtration time t pro-
vided all the constants are known, a and r m for a particular
filtration must be evaluated beforehand. For experimental
determination of a and r m, Eq. (10.10) is rearranged by divid-
ing both sides of the equation by A Vf:

K 1 and K 2 are constant during constant-pressure filtration.
Eq. (10.12) is therefore an equation of a straight line when t/vf
is plotted against Vf. The slope K 1 depends on the filtration
pressure drop and properties of the cake; the intercept K2 also
depends on pressure drop but is independent of cake proper-
ties. a is calculated from the slope; rm is determined from the
intercept. Eq. (10.12) is valid for compressible cakes; however
K 1 becomes a more complex function of Ap than is directly
apparent from Eq. (10.13) because of the dependence of a on
pressure.
Eq. (10.11) is the basic filtration equation for industrial-
scale equipment such as the rotary-drum vacuum filter shown
in Figure 10.4; rates of filtration during cake formation and
washing determine the size of the filter required for the pro-
cess. Simple modifications to Eq. (10.11) give equations
which are directly applicable to rotary-drum filters [2].
Filtration of mycelial broth
A 30-ml sample of broth from a penicillin fermentation is filtered in the laboratory on a 3 cm 2 filter at a pressure drop of 5 psi.
The filtration time is 4.5 min. Previous studies have shown that filter cake of Penicillium chrysogenumis significantly compress-
ible with s = 0.5. If 500 litres broth from a pilot-scale fermenter must be filtered in 1 hour, what size filter is required if the
pressure drop is:
(a) 10 psi?
(b) 5 psi?
Resistance due to the filter medium is negligible.

Halving the pressure drop increases the area required by only 20% because at 5 psi the cake is less compressed and more porous
than at 10 psi.
Example 10.1 underlines the importance of laboratory testing
in design of filtration systems. Experiments are required to
evaluate properties of the cake such as compressibility and
specific resistance; these parameters cannot be calculated from
theory. Experimental observations are also necessary to evalu-
ate a wide range of other important filtration characteristics.
These include filtrate clarity, ease of washing, dryness of the
final cake, ease of cake removal, and effects of filter aids and
broth pre-treatment. It is essential that any laboratory tests be
conducted with the same materials as the large-scale process.
Variables such as temperature, age of the broth, and presence
of contaminants and cell debris have significant effects on fil-
tration characteristics.
In general, fungal mycelia are filtered relatively easily
because mycelial filter cake has sufficiently large porosity.
Yeast and bacteria are much more difficult to handle because
of their small size. Alternative filtration methods which elimi-
nate the filter cake are becoming more accepted for bacterial
and yeast separations. Microfiltrationis achieved by develop-
ing large cross-flow fluid velocities across the filter surface
while the velocity normal to the surface is relatively small.
Build-up of filter cake and problems of high cake resistance are
therefore prevented. Microfiltration is not covered in this text;
further details are available elsewhere, e.g. [3, 4].
10.2 Centrifugation
Centrifugation is used to separate materials of different den-
sity when a force greater than gravity is desired. In

bioprocessing, centrifugation is used to remove cells from fer-
mentation broth, to eliminate cell debris, to collect
precipitates, and to prepare fermentation media such as in
clarification of molasses or production of wort for brewing.
Equipment for centrifugation is more expensive than for filtra-
tion; however centrifugation is often effective when the
particles are very small and difficult to filter. Centrifugation of
fermentation broth produces a thick, concentrated cell sludge
or cream containing more liquid than filter cake.
Steam-sterilisable centrifuges are applied when either the
cells or fermentation liquid is recycled to the fermenter or
when product contamination must be prevented. Industrial
centrifuges generate large amounts of heat due to friction; it is
therefore necessary to have good ventilation and cooling.
Aerosols created by fast-spinning centrifuges have been known
to cause infections and allergic reactions in factory workers so
that isolation cabinets are required for certain applications.

Centrifugation is most effective when the particles to be
separated are large, the liquid viscosity is low, and the density
difference between particles and fluid is great. It is also assisted
by large centrifuge radius and high rotational speed. In centri-
fugation of biological solids such as cells, the particles are very
small, the viscosity of the medium can be relatively high, and
the particle density is very similar to the suspending fluid.
These disadvantages are easily overcome in the laboratory with
small centrifuges operated at high speed. However, problems
arise in industrial centrifugation when large quantities of
material must be treated. Centrifuge capacity cannot be
increased by simply increasing the size of the equipment with-
out limit; mechanical stress in centrifuges increases in
proportion to (radius) 2 so that safe operating speeds are sub-
stantially lower in large equipment. The need for continuous
throughput of material in industrial applications also restricts
practical operating speeds. To overcome these difficulties, a

range of centrifuges has been developed for bioprocessing.
Types of centrifuge commonly used in industrial operations
are described below.
10.2.1 Centrifuge Equipment
Centrifuge equipment is classified according to internal
structure. The tubular-bowl centrifuge has the simplest
configuration and is widely employed in the food and pharma-
ceutical industries. Feed enters under pressure through a
nozzle at the bottom, is accelerated to rotor speed, and moves
upwards through the cylindrical bowl. As the bowl rotates,
particles travelling upward are spun out and collide with the
walls of the bowl as illustrated schematically in Figure 10.5.
Solids are removed from the liquid if they move with sufficient
velocity to reach the wall of the bowl within the residence time
of liquid in the machine. As the feed rate is increased the liquid
layer moving up the wall of the centrifuge becomes thicker;
this reduces performance of the centrifuge by increasing the
distance a particle must travel to reach the wall. Liquid from
the feed spills over a weir at the top of the bowl; solids which
have collided with the walls are collected separately. When the
thickness of sediment collecting in the bowl reaches the posi-
n
s

,

tion of the liquid-overflow weir, separation efficiency declines
rapidly. This limits the capacity of the centrifuge. Tubular
centrifuges are applied mainly for difficult separations requir-
ing high centrifugal forces. Solids in tubular centrifuges are
accelerated by forces between 13 000 and 16 000 times the
force of gravity.
A type of narrow tubular-bowl centrifuge is the ultracentri-
fuge. This device is used for recovery of fine precipitates from
high-density solutions, for breaking down emulsions, and for
separation of colloidal particles such as ribosomes and mito-
chondria. It produces centrifugal forces 105-106 times the
force of gravity. The bowl is usually air-driven and operated at
low pressure or in an atmosphere of nitrogen to reduce
generation of frictional heat. The main commercial applica-
tion of ultracentrifuges has been in production of vaccines to
separate viral particles from cell debris. Ultracentrifugation
has also been tested for removal of very fine cell debris in isola-
tion of enzymes, and for ribosome removal in purification of
RNA polymerase. A typical ultracentrifuge operates discon-
tinuously so its processing capacity is restricted by the need to
empty the bowl manually. Continuous ultracentrifuges are
available commercially; however safe operating speeds with
these machines are not as high as in batch equipment.
An alternative to the tubular centrifuge is the disc-stack
bowl centrifuge. Disc-stack centrifuges are common in bio-
processing. There are many types of disc centrifuge; the
principal difference between them is the method used to dis-
charge the accumulated solid. In simple disc centrifuges, solids
must be removed periodically by hand. Continuous or inter-
mittent discharge of solids is possible in a variety of disc cen-
trifuges without reducing the bowl speed. Some centrifuges
are equipped with peripheral nozzles for continuous solids
removal; others have valves for intermittent discharge.
Another method is to concentrate the solids in the periphery of
the bowl and then discharge them at the top of the centrifuge
using a paring device; the equipment configuration for this
mode of operation is shown in Figure 10.6. A disadvantage of
centrifuges with automatic discharge of solids is that the solids
must remain sufficiently wet to flow through the machine.
Extra nozzles may be provided for cleaning the bowl should
blockages of the system occur.
Disc-stack centrifuges contain conical sheets of metal
called discs which are stacked one on top of the other with
clearances as small as 0.3 mm. The discs rotate with the bowl
and their function is to split the liquid into thin layers. As
shown in Figure 10.7, feed is released near the bottom of the
centrifuge and travels upwards through matching holes in the
discs. Between the discs, heavy components of the feed are
thrown outward under the influence of centrifugal forces aszo Unit Operations
m2,8
lighter liquid is displaced towards the centre of the bowl. As
they are flung out, the solids strike the undersides of the discs
and slide down to the bottom edge of the bowl. At the same
time, the lighter liquid flows in and over the upper surfaces of
the discs to be discharged from the top of the bowl. Heavier
liquid containing solids can be discharged either at the top of
the centrifuge or through nozzles around the periphery of the
bowl. Disc-stack centrifuges used in bioprocessing typically
develop forces of 5000-15 000 times gravity. As a guide, the
minimum density difference between solid and liquid for suc-
cessful separation in a disc-stack centrifuge is approximately
0.01-0.03 kg m-3; in practical operations at appropriate flow
rates the minimum particle diameter separated is about
0.5/*m [5].
10.2.2 Centrifugation Theory
The particle velocity achieved in a particular centrifuge com-
pared with the settling velocity which would occur under the
influence of gravity characterises the effectiveness of centrifu-
gation. The terminal velocity during gravity settling of a small
spherical particle in dilute suspension is given by Stoke's law:
ug = P ? - q D~g
18/,
(10.15)
where ug is the sedimentation velocity under gravity, pp is
density of the particle, PFis density of the liquid,/, is viscosity
of the liquid, Dp is particle diameter and g is gravitational
acceleration. In a centrifuge, the corresponding terminal
velocity is:
Uc = P / ' - P /
18/,
Dpco2r
gravity, and is often expressed as so many g-forces. Industrial
centrifuges have Z factors from 300 to 16 000; for small
laboratory centrifuges Zmay be up to 500 000 [6].
Sedimentation occurs in a centrifuge as particles moving
away from the centre of rotation collide with the walls of the
centrifuge bowl. Increasing the velocity of motion will
improve the rate of sedimentation. From Eq. (10.16), particle
velocity in a given centrifuge can be increased by:
(i) increasing the centrifuge speed co;
(ii) increasing the particle diameter Dp;
(iii) increasing the density difference between particle and
liquid, pp - pf; and
(iv) decreasing the viscosity of the suspending fluid,/*.
However, whether the particles reach the walls of the bowl also
depends on the time of exposure to the centrifugal force. In
batch centrifuges such as those used in the laboratory, centri-
fuge time is increased by running the equipment longer. In
continuous-flow devices such as the disc-stack centrifuge, the
residence time is increased by decreasing the feed flow rate.
Performance of centrifuges of different size can be com-
pared using a parameter called the sigmafactorZ. Physically, Z
represents the cross-sectional area of a gravity settler with the
same sedimentation characteristics as the centrifuge. For con-
tinuous centrifuges, E is related to the feed rate of material as
follows:
Q
2u g
(10.18)
where Q is the volumetric feed rate and u is the terminal
velocity of the particles in a gravitational fie~d. If two centri-
fuges perform with equal effectiveness:
(10.16)
where u c is particle velocity in the centrifuge, co is angular
velocity of the bowl in units of rad s- 1 and r is radius of the
centrifuge drum. The ratio of velocity in the centrifuge to
velocity under gravity is called the centrifugeeffector g-number,
and is usually denoted Z. Therefore:

The above equations for 2; are based on ideal operating
conditions. Because different types of centrifuge deviate to
varying degrees from ideal operation, Eq. (10.19) cannot
generally be used to compare different centrifuge configura-
tions. Performance of any centrifuge can deviate from
theoretical prediction due to factors such as particle shape and
size distribution, aggregation of particles, non-uniform flow
distribution in the centrifuge and interaction between par-
ticles during sedimentation. Experimental tests must be per-
formed to account for these factors.
Example 10.2 Cell recovery in a disc-stack centrifuge
A continuous disc-stack centrifuge is operated at 5000 rpm for separation of bakers' yeast. At a feed rate of 60 1 min-1, 50% of
the cells are recovered. At constant centrifuge speed, solids recovery is inversely proportional to flow rate.
(a) What flow rate is required to achieve 90% cell recovery if the centrifuge speed is maintained at 5000 rpm?
(b) What operating speed is required to achieve 90% recovery at a feed rate of 60 1 min-1?
Solution:
(a) If solids recovery is inversely proportional to feed rate, the flow rate required is:
50%
(601 m i n - 1) = 33.31 min - 1.

10.3 Cell Disruption
Downstream processing of fermentation broths usually begins
with separation of cells by filtration or centrifugation. The
next step depends on location of the desired product. For sub-
stances such as ethanol, citric acid and antibiotics which are
excreted from cells, product is recovered from the cell-free
broth using unit operations such as those described later in thisIO Unit Operations

sufficient to completely disrupt many types of cell. A common
apparatus for homogenisation of cells is the Manton-Gaulin
homogeniser. As indicated in Figure 10.8, this high-pressure
pump incorporates an adjustable valve with restricted orifice
through which cells are forced at pressures up to 550 atm. The
homogeniser is of general applicability for cell disruption,
although the homogenising valve can become blocked when
used with highly filamentous organisms.

chapter. Biomass separated from the liquid is discarded or sold
as a by-product.
For products such as enzymes and recombinant proteins
which remain in the biomass, cell disruption must be carried
out to release the desired material. A variety of methods is
available to disrupt cells. Mechanical options include grinding
with abrasives, high-speed agitation, high-pressure pumping
and ultrasound. Non-mechanical methods such as osmotic
shock, freezing and thawing, enzymic digestion of cell walls,
and treatment with solvents and detergents can also be
applied.
A widely-used technique for cell disruption is high-pressure
homogenisation. Shear forces generated in this treatment are
Figure 10.9
(Rm)
In Eq. (10.23), R m is the maximum amount of protein avail-
able for release, R is the amount of protein released after N
passes through the homogeniser, k is a temperature-dependent
rate constant, and p is the operating pressure. The exponent a
is a measure of the resistance of the cells to disruption. For
Saccharomyces cerevisiaeyeast, a has been determined as 2.9
[ 10]; however the exponent for a particular organism depends
to some extent on growth conditions [ 11 ]. The strong depen-
dence of protein release on pressure suggests that
high-pressure operation is beneficial; complete disruption in a
single pass may be possible if the pressure is sufficiently high.
Reduction in the number of passes through the homogeniser is
generally preferable because multiple passes produce fine cell
debris which can cause problems in subsequent clarification
steps.

Release of protein is markedly dependent on temperature;
protein recovery increases at elevated temperatures up to
50~ However, cooling to 0-4~ is recommended during
operation of homogenisers to minimise protein denaturation.
Procedures for scale-up of homogenisers are not well
developed. Methods which work well in the laboratory may
give variable results when used at a larger scale.
10.4
The Ideal-Stage Concept
So far, we have considered only the initial steps of downstream
processing: cell isolation and disruption. An important group
of unit operations used for primary isolation of fermentation
products relies on mass transfer to achieve separation of com-
ponents between phases. Equipment for these separations
sometimes consists of a series of stages in which the phases
make intimate contact so that material can be transferred
between them. Even if the equipment itself is not constructed
in discrete stages, mass transfer can be considered to occur in
stages. The effectiveness of each stage in accomplishing mass
transfer depends on many factors, including equipment
design, physical properties of the phases, and equilibrium rela-
tionships.
Consider the simple mixer-settler device of Figure 10.9 for
extraction of component A from one liquid phase to another.
The mass-transfer principles of liquid-liquid extraction have
already been described in Chapter 9; unit operations for
extraction are also discussed in the next section. Here, we will
use the mixer-settler to explain the general concept of ideal
stages. Two immiscible liquids enter the mixing vessel with
volumetric flow rates Lil and Li2; these streams contain A at
concentrations Cai 1 and C~2, respectively. The two liquid
phases are vigorously mixed together and A is transferred from
one phase to the other. The mixture then passes to a settler
where phase separation is allowed to occur under the influence
of gravity. The flow rate of light liquid out of the settler is Lol;
the flow rate of heavy liquid is Lo2. Concentrations of A in
these streams are CAo I and CAo2, respectively.
Operation of the mixer-settler relies on the liquids entering
not being in equilibrium as far as concentration of A is con-
cerned, i.e. CAi1 and CAi2 are not equilibrium concentrations.
This means that there exists a driving force in the mixer for
change of concentration as A is transferred from one liquid to
the other. Depending on the ability of the mixer to promote
mass transfer between the liquids and the effectiveness of the
settler in allowing phase separation, when the liquids leave the
system they will have been brought closer to equilibrium. If
the mixer-settler were an ideal stage the two streams leaving it
would be in equilibrium. No further mass transfer of A would
Z3I
result from additional contact between the phases; CAo1 and
CAo2 would be equilibrium concentrations and the device
would be operating at maximum efficiency. In reality, stages
are not ideal; the change in concentration achieved in a real
stage is always less than in an ideal stage so that extra stages are
necessary to achieve the desired separation. The relative per-
formance of an actual stage compared with that of an ideal
stage is expressed as the stage efficiency.
The concept of ideal stages is used in design calculations for
several unit operations. The important elements in analysis of
these operations are material balances, energy balances if appli-
cable, and the equilibrium relationships between phases.
Application of these principles is illustrated in the following
sections.
10.5 Aqueous Two-Phase Liquid Extraction
Liquid extraction is used to isolate many pharmaceutical prod-
ucts from animal and plant sources. In liquid extraction of
fermentation products, components dissolved in liquid are
recovered by transfer into an appropriate solvent. Extraction
of penicillin from aqueous broth using solvents such as butyl
acetate, amyl acetate or methyl isobutyl ketone, and isolation
of erythromycin using pentyl or amyl acetate are examples.
Solvent extraction techniques are also applied for recovery of
steroids, purification of vitamin B12 from microbial sources,
and isolation of alkaloids such as morphine and codeine from
raw plant material. The simplest equipment for liquid extrac-
tion is the separating funnel used for laboratory-scale product
recovery. Liquids forming two distinct phases are shaken
together in the separating funnel; solute in dilute solution in
one solvent transfers to the other solvent to form a more con-
centrated solution. The two phases are then allowed to
separate and the heavy phase is withdrawn from the bottom of
the funnel. The phase containing the solute in concentrated
form is processed further to purify the product. Whatever
apparatus is used for extraction, it is important that contact
between the liquid phases is maximised by vigorous mixing
and turbulence to facilitate solute transfer.
Extraction with organic solvents is a major separation tech-
nique in bioprocessing, particularly for recovery of antibiotics.
However, organic solvents are unsuitable for isolation of pro-
teins and other sensitive biopolymers. Techniques are being
developed for aqueous two-phase extraction of these mole-
cules. Aqueous solvents which form two distinct phases
provide favourable conditions for separation of proteins, cell
fragments and organelles with protection of their biological
activity. Two-phase aqueous systems are produced when parti-
cular polymers or a polymer and salt are dissolved together inIO Unit Op

water above certain concentrations. The liquid partitions into
two phases, each containing 85-99% water. Some compo-
nents used to form aqueous two-phase systems are listed in
Table 10.2. When added to these mixtures, biomolecules and
cell fragments partition between the phases; by selecting
appropriate conditions, cell fragments can be confined to one
phase as the protein of interest partitions into the other phase.
Aqueous two-phase separations are of special interest for
extraction of enzymes and recombinant proteins from cell
debris produced by cell disruption. After partitioning, product
is removed from the extracting phase using other unit opera-
tions such as precipitation or crystallisation.
The extent of differential partitioning between phases
depends on the equilibrium relationship for the system. The

if K< 1, A is concentrated in the lower phase. In many aqueous
systems K is constant over a wide range of concentrations pro,
vided the molecular properties of the phases are not changed.
Partitioning is influenced by the size, electric charge and hydro-
phobicity of the particles or solute molecules; biospecific affinity
for one of the polymers may also play a role in some systems.
Surface free energy of the phase components and ionic composi-
tion of the liquids are of paramount importance in determining
separation; Kis related to both these parameters. Partitioning is
also affected by other and sometimes interdependent factors so
that it is impossible to predict partition coefficients from molec-
ular properties. For single-stage extraction of enzymes, partition
coefficients ~> 3 are normally required [5].
Even when the partition coefficient is low, good product

Aqueous extraction in polyethylene glycol-salt mixtures is an
effective technique for separating proteins from cell debris. In
this system, debris partitions to the lower phase while most of
the target proteins are recovered from the upper phase.
Extraction can be carried out in a single-'stage operation such
as that depicted in Figure 10.9 using a polymer mixture which
provides a suitable partition coefficient. Equilibrium is
approached in extraction operations but rarely reached; for
industrial application it is important to consider the time
taken for mass transfer and the ease of mechanical separation
of the phases. The rate of approach to equilibrium depends on
the surface area available for exchange between the phases; this
is maximised by rapid mixing. Separation of the phases isIO Unit Operations
sometimes a problem because of the low interfacial tension
between aqueous phases; very rapid large-scale extractions can
be achieved by combining mixed vessels with centrifugal sep-
arators. In many cases, recovery and concentration of product
with yields exceeding 90% can be achieved using a single
extraction step [5]. When single-stage extraction does not give
sufficient recovery, repeated extractions can be carried out in a
chain or cascade of contacting and separation units.

10.6 Adsorption
Adsorption is a surface phenomenon whereby components of a
gas or liquid are concentrated on the surface of solid particles or
at fluid interfaces. Adsorption is the result of electrostatic, van
der Waals, reactive or other binding forces between individual
atoms, ions or molecules. Four types of adsorption can be dis-
tinguished: exchange, physical, chemical and non-specific.
Adsorption serves the same function as extraction in isolat-
ing products from dilute fermentation liquors. Several different
adsorption operations are used in bioprocessing, particularly
for medical and pharmaceutical products. Ion-exchange
adsorption is established practice for recovery of amino acids,
proteins, antibiotics and vitamins. Adsorption onto activated
charcoal is a method of long standing for purification of citric
acid; adsorption of organic chemicals onto charcoal or porous
polymeric adsorbents is common in wastewater treatment.
Adsorption operations generally have higher selectivity but
smaller capacity than extraction. Scale-up procedures for
adsorption are less well defined than for extraction; therefore,
more experimental data are required for design. Handling of
solids in industrial processing is also somewhat more difficult
compared with the liquids used in extraction. However, despite
these disadvantages, adsorption is gaining increasing applica-
tion primarily because of its suitability for protein isolation.
In adsorption operations, the substance being concentrated
on the surface is called the adsorbate; the material to which the
adsorbate binds is the adsorbent. The ideal adsorbent material
has a high surface area per unit volume; this can be achieved if
the solid contains a network of fine internal pores which pro-
vide an extremely large internal surface area. Carbons and
synthetic resins based on styrene, divinylbenzene or acryla-
mide polymers are commonly used for adsorption of
biological molecules. Commercially available adsorbents are
porous granular or gel resins with void volumes of 30-50%
and pore diameters generally less than 0.01 mm. As an
example, the total surface area in particles of activated carbon
ranges from 450 to 1800 m 2 g- 1. Not all of this area is neces-
sarily available for adsorption; adsorbate molecules only have
access to surfaces in pores of appropriate diameter.

10.6.1 Adsorption Operations
A typical adsorption operation consists of the following stages:
a contacting or adsorption step which loads solute onto the
adsorptive resin, a washingstep to remove residual unadsorbed
material, desorption or e/ution of adsorbate with a suitable sol-
vent, washing to remove residual eluant, and regeneration of
the adsorption resin to its original condition. Because adsor-
bate is bound to the resin by physical or ionic forces,
conditions used for desorption must overcome these forces.
Desorption is normally accomplished by feeding a stream of
different ionic strength or pH; elution with organic solvent or
reaction of the sorbed material may be necessary in some appli-
cations. Eluant containing stripped solute in concentrated
form is processed to recover the adsorbate; operations for final
purification include spray drying, precipitation and crystallisa-
tion. After elution, the adsorbent undergoes a regenerative
treatment to remove any impurities and regain its original
adsorptive capacity. Despite regeneration, performance of the
resin will decrease with use as complete removal of adsorbedI 0 Unit O

material is impossible. Accordingly, after a few regenerations
the adsorbate is replaced.
10.6.2 Equilibrium Relationships For
Adsorption
Like extraction, analysis of adsorption depends somewhat on
equilibrium relationships which determine the extent to
which material can be adsorbed onto a particular surface.
When an adsorbate and adsorbent are at equilibrium there is a
defined distribution of solute between solid and fluid phases
and no further net adsorption occurs. Adsorption equilib-
rium data are available as adsorption isotherms. For adsorbate A,
an isotherm gives the concentration of A in the adsorbed phase
versus the concentration in the unadsorbed phase at a given
temperature. Adsorption isotherms are useful for selecting the
most appropriate adsorbent; they also play a crucial role in pre-
dicting the performance of adsorption systems.
Several types of equilibrium isotherm have been developed
to describe adsorption relationships. However, no single
model is universally applicable; all involve assumptions which
may or may not be valid in particular cases. One of the sim-
plest adsorption isotherms that accurately describes certain
practical systems is the Langmuir isotherm shown in Figure
10.10(a). The Langmuir isotherm can be expressed as follows:
CASm KA C*A
I+KAC ~
(10.30)
In Eq. (10.30), C ~ is the equilibrium concentration or loading
of A on the adsorbent in units of, e.g. kg solute kg- 1 solid or kg
solute m -3 solid. CAS m is the maximum loading of adsorbate
corresponding to complete monolayer coverage of all available
adsorption sites, C~t is the equilibrium concentration of solute
o
n
s
2
,

$
in the fluid phase in units of, e.g. kg m -3, and K A is a constant.
Because of the different units used for fluid- and solid-phase
concentrations, K A usually has units such as m 3 kg- ~solid.
Theoretically, Langmuir adsorption is applicable to
systems where: (i) adsorbed molecules form no more than a
monolayer on the surface; (ii) each site for adsorption is equiv-
alent in terms of adsorption energy; and (iii) there are no
interactions between adjacent adsorbed molecules. In many
experimental systems at least one of these conditions is not
met. For example, many commercial adsorbents possess high-
ly irregular surfaces so that adsorption is favoured at particular
points or 'strong sites' on the surface. Accordingly, each site is
not equivalent. In addition, interactions between adsorbed
molecules exist for almost all real adsorption systems.
Recognition of these and other factors has led to application of
other adsorption isotherms.
Of particular interest because of its widespread use in
liquid-solid systems is the Freundlich isotherm, described by
the relationship:
C'AS "- K F C*A1/n.
(10.31)
K F and n are constants characteristic of the particular adsorp-
tion system; the dimensions of K F depend on the dimensions
of C~ts and C~t and the value of n. Ifadsorption is favourable n
is > 1; if adsorption is unfavourable n is < 1. The form of the
Freundlich isotherm is shown in Figure 10.10(b). Eq. (10.31)
applies to adsorption of a wide variety of antibiotics, hormones
and steroids.
There are many other forms of adsorption isotherm giving
different C ~ s - C~ curves [12]. Because the exact mech-
anisms of adsorption are not well understood, adsorption
equilibrium data must be determined experimentally.
Example 10.4 Antibody recovery by adsorption
Cell-free fermentation liquor contains 8 x 10 -5 mol l-1 immunoglobulin G. It is proposed to recover at least 90% of this anti-
body by adsorption on synthetic, non-polar resin. Experimental equilibrium data are correlated as follows:
C~ S = 5.5 x 10- 5 C~O.35
where C~ts is mol solute adsorbed per cm 3 adsorbent and C~ is liquid-phase solute concentration in mol 1-1. What minimum
quantity of resin is required to treat 2 m 3 fermentation liquor in a single-stage mixed tank?
Solution:
The quantity of resin required is minimum when equilibrium occurs. If 90% of the antibiotic is adsorbed, the residual concen-
tration in the liquid is:I0 Unit O

10.6.3 Performance Characteristics of
Fixed-Bed Adsorbers
Various types of equipment have been developed for adsorp-
tion operations, including fixed beds, moving beds, fluidised
beds and stirred-tank contactors. Of these, fixed-bed adsorbers
are most commonly applied; the adsorption area available per
unit volume is greater in fixed beds than in most other configu-
rations. A fixed-bed adsorber is a vertical column or tube
packed with adsorbent particles. Commercial adsorption oper-
ations are mostly performed as unsteady-state processes; liquid
containing solute is passed through the bed and the loading or
amount of product retained in the column increases with time.
Operation of a downflow fixed-bed adsorber is illustrated
in Figure 10.11. Liquid solution containing adsorbate at con-
centration CAi is fed at the top of a column which is initially
z37
free of adsorbate. At first, adsorbent resin at the top of the col-
umn takes up solute rapidly; solution passing through the
column becomes depleted of solute and leaves the system with
effluent concentration close to zero. As flow of solution con-
tinues, the region of the bed where most adsorption occurs,
the adsorption zone, moves down the column as the top resin
becomes saturated with solute in equilibrium with liquid con-
centration Cal. Movement of the adsorption zone usually
occurs at a speed much lower than the velocity of fluid through
the bed, and is called the adsorption wave. Eventually the lower
edge of the adsorption zone reaches the bottom of the bed, the
resin is almost completely saturated, and the concentration of
solute in the effluent starts to rise appreciably; this is called the
breakpoint. As the adsorption zone passes through the bottom
of the bed, the resin can no longer adsorb solute and the efflu-
ent concentration rises to the inlet value, CAp At this time
the bed is completely saturated with adsorbate and must be
regenerated. The curve in Figure 10.11 showing effluent
concentration as a function of time or volume of material pro-
cessed is known as the breakthrough curve.
The shape of the breakthrough curve greatly influences
design and operation of fixed-bed adsorbers. Figure 10.12
shows the portion of the breakthrough curve between times t3
and t4 when solute appears in the column effluent. The
amount of solute lost in the effluent is given by the area under
the breakthrough curve. As indicated in Figure 10.12(a), if
adsorption continues until the entire bed is saturated and the
effluent concentration equals CAi, a considerable amount of
solute is wasted. To avoid this, adsorption operations are usu-
ally stopped before the bed is completely saturated. As shown
in Figure 10.12(b), if adsorption is halted at time t' when the
effluent concentration is C)t, only a small amount of solute is
wasted compared with the process of Figure 10.12(a). The dis-
advantage is that some portion of the bed capacity is unused, as
represented by the shaded area above the breakthrough curve.
Because of the importance of the breakthrough curve in deter-
mining schedules of operation, much effort has been given to
its prediction and to analysis of factors affecting it. This is dis-
cussed further in the next section.
10.6.4 Engineering Analysis of Fixed-Bed
Adsorbers
In design of fixed-bed adsorbers, the quantity of resin and the
time required for adsorption of a given quantity of solute must
be estimated. Design procedures involve predicting the shape of
the breakthrough curve and the time of appearance of the break-
point. The form of the breakthrough curve is influenced by
factors such as feed rate, concentration of solute in the feed,
nature of the adsorption equilibrium and rate of adsorption.Io Unit Op

very thin so that z is approximately the same anywhere in the
section. The system boundary is indicated in Figure 10.13 by

Performance of commercial adsorbers is usually controlled by
adsorption rate. This in turn depends on mass-transfer processes
within and outside the adsorbent particles. One approach to
adsorber design is to conduct extensive pilot studies to examine
the effects of major system variables. However, the duration and
cost of these experimental studies can be minimised by prior
mathematical analysis of the process. Because fixed-bed adsorp-
tion is an unsteady-state process and equations for adsorption
isotherms are generally non-linear, the calculations involved in
engineering analysis are relatively complex compared with
many other unit operations. Non-homogeneous packing in
adsorption beds and the difficulty of obtaining reproducible
results in apparently identical beds add to these problems. It is
beyond the scope of this book to consider design procedures in
any depth as considerable effort and research is required to
establish predictive models for adsorption systems. However, a
simplified engineering analysis is presented below.
Let us consider the processes which cause changes in the liq-
uid-phase concentration of adsorbate in a fixed-bed adsorber.
The aim of this analysis is to derive an equation for effluent con-
centration as a function of time (the breakthrough curve). The
technique used is the mass balance. Consider the column
packed with adsorbent resin shown in Figure 10.13. Liquid con-
taining solute A is fed at the top of the column and flows down

(4.1)
Let us consider each term of Eq. (4.1) to see how it applies to
solute A in the designated section of the column. First, because
we assume there are no chemical reactions taking place and A
can be neither generated nor consumed, the third and fourth
terms of Eq. (4.1) are zero. On the left-hand side, this leaves
only the input and output terms. What are the mechanisms for
input of component A to the section of column? A is brought
into the section largely as a result of liquid flow down the col-
umn; this is indicated in Figure 10.13 by the solid arrow
entering the section. Other mechanisms are related to local
mixing and diffusion processes within the interstices or gaps
between the resin particles. For example, some A may enter the
section from the region just below it by countercurrent diffu-
sion against the direction of flow; this is indicated in Figure
10.13 by the wiggly arrow entering the section from below. Let
us now consider movement of A out of the system. The mecha-
nisms for removal of A are the same as for entry: A is carried out
of the section by liquid flow and by axial transfer along the
length of the tube against the direction of flow. These processes
are also indicated in Figure 10.13. The remaining term in Eq.
(4.1) is accumulation ofA. A will accumulate within the section
due to adsorption onto the interior and exterior surfaces of the
adsorbent particles. A may also accumulate in liquid trapped
within the interstitial spaces or gaps between resin particles.
When appropriate mathematical expressions for rates of
flow, axial dispersion and accumulation are substituted into
Eq. (4.1), the following equation is obtained:

ume of the resin particles, u is the interstitial liquid velocity,
defined as:

(10.34)
where F L is the volumetric liquid flow rate and A c is the cross-
sectional area of the column. In Eq. (10.32), 8[dt denotes the
partial differential with respect to time, a/dzdenotes the partial
differential with respect to distance, and a2/dz2 denotes the
second partial differential with respect to distance. Although
Eq. (10.32) looks complicated, it is useful to recognise the
physical meaning of its components. As indicated below each
term of the equation, rates of axial dispersion, flow, and accu-
mulation in the liquid and solid phases are represented;
accumulation is equal to the sum of the net rates of axial diffu-
sion and flow into the system.
There are four variables in Eq. (10.32): concentration of
A in the liquid, CA; concentration of A in the solid, CAS; dis-
tance from the top of the column, z; and time, t. The other
parameters can be considered constant. C A and CAS vary
with time of operation and depth in the column.
Theoretically, with the aid of further information about the
system, Eq. (10.32) can be solved to provide an equation for
the effluent concentration as a function of time: the break-
through curve. However, solution ofEq. (10.32) is generally
very difficult. To assist the analysis, simplifying assumptions
are often made. For example, it is normally assumed that
dilute solutions are being processed; this results in nearly iso-
thermal operation and eliminates the need for an
accompanying energy balance for the system. In many cases
the axial-diffusion term can be neglected; axial dispersion is
generally significant only at low flow rates. If the interstitial
To progress further with this analysis, information about
a CAS]at is required. This term represents the rate of change of
solid-phase adsorbate concentration and depends on the over-
all rate at which adsorption takes place. Overall rate of
adsorption depends on two factors: the rate at which solute is
transferred from liquid to solid by mass-transfer mechanisms,
and the rate of the actual adsorption or attachment process.
The mass-transfer pathway for adsorbate is analogous to that
described in Section 9.5.2 for oxygen transfer. There are up to
five steps which can pose significant resistance to adsorption as
indicated in Figure 10.14. They are:
(i)
transfer from the bulk liquid to the liquid boundary layer
surrounding the particle;
(ii) diffusion through the relatively stagnant liquid film sur-
rounding the particle;
(iii) transfer through the liquid in the pores of the particle to
internal surfaces;
(iv) the actual adsorption process; and
(v) surface diffusion along the internal pore surfaces; i.e.
migration of adsorbate molecules within the surface
without prior desorption.
Normally only a small amount of adsorption occurs on the
outer perimeter of the particle compared to within the pores;
accordingly, external adsorption is not shown in Figure
10.14. Bulk transfer of solute is usually rapid because of mix-
ing and convective flow of liquid passing over the solid; the
effect of step (i) on overall adsorption rate can therefore be
neglected. The adsorption step itself is sometimes very slow
and can become the rate-limiting process; however in most
cases adsorption occurs relatively quickly so that step (iv) is
not rate-controlling. Step (ii) represents the major external
resistance to mass transfer, while steps (iii) and (v) represent
the major internal resistances. Any or all of these steps can
control the overall rate of adsorption depending on the situa-
tion. Rate-controlling steps are usually identified
experimentally using a small column with packing identical
to the industrial-scale system; mass-transfer coefficients can
then be measured under appropriate flow conditions.Io UnitOp

Unfortunately however, it is possible that the rate-controlling
step changes as the process is scaled up, making rational
design difficult.
Greatest simplification of Eq. (10.35) is obtained when the
overall rate of mass transfer from liquid to internal surfaces is
represented by a single equation. For example, by analogy with
Eq. (9.34) or (9.35), we can write:
O~CAs
~)t
KLa
=
1 -e
(cA- c),)
(10.36)
where K L is the overall mass-transfer coefficient, a is the sur-
face area of the solid per unit volume, C A is the liquid-phase
concentration of A, and C~l is the liquid-phase concentration
of A in equilibrium with CAS. The value of K L will depend on
the properties of the liquid and the flow conditions; C~l can be
related to CAS by the equilibrium isotherm. In the end, after
the differential equations are simplified as much as possible
and then integrated with appropriate boundary conditions
(usually with a computer), the result is a relationship between
effluent concentration (C A at z = L) and time. The height of
the column required to achieve a certain recovery of solute can
also be evaluated.
As mentioned already in this section, there are many uncer-
tainties associated with design and scale up of adsorption
systems. The approach described here will give only an
approximate indication of design and operating parameters.
Other methods involving various simplifying assumptions can
be employed [2]. The above analysis highlights the important
role played by mass transfer in practical adsorption operations.
Equilibrium is seldom achieved in commercial adsorption systems;
performance is controlled by the overall rate of adsorption. Most
parameters determining the economics of adsorption are those
affecting mass transfer. Improvement in adsorber operation
can be achieved by enhancing rates of diffusion and reducing
mass-transfer resistance.

tures and isolating components. Many of the principlesIO Unit Operations

injected into a column. As solvent flows through the column,
the solutes travel at different speeds depending on their rela-
tive affinities for the resin particles. As a result, they will b e

different times. The pattern of solute peaks emerging from a
chromatography column is called a chromatogram. The fluid
carrying solutes through the column or used for elution is
known as the mobilephase; the material which stays inside the
column and effects the separation is called the stationaryphase.

(iii) Ion-exchange chromatography. The basis of separation in
this procedure is electrostatic attraction between the
solute and dense clusters of charged groups on the col-
umn packing. Ion-exchange chromatography can give
high resolution of macromolecules and is used commer-
cially for fractionation of antibiotics and proteins.
Column packings for low-molecular-weight compounds
include silica, glass and polystyrene; carboxymethyl and
diethylaminoethyl groups attached to cellulose, agarose
or dextran provide suitable resins for protein chromatog-
raphy. Solutes are eluted by changing the pH or ionic
strength of the liquid phase; salt gradients are the most
common way of eluting proteins from ion exchangers.
Practical aspects of protein ion-exchange chromatog-
raphy are described in greater detail elsewhere [ 15].
(iv) Gel chromatography. This technique is also known as
molecular-sieve chromatography, exclusion chromatog-
raphy, gel filtration and gel-permeation chromatography.
Molecules in solution are separated in a column packed
with gel particles of defined porosity. Gels most often
used are cross-linked dextrans, agaroses and polyacryl-
amide gels. The speed with which components travel
through the column depends on their effective molecular
size. Large molecules are completely excluded from the
gel matrix and move rapidly through the column to
appear first in the chromatogram. Small molecules are
able to penetrate the pores of the packing, traverse the
column very slowly, and appear last in the chromato-
gram. Molecules of intermediate size enter the pores but
spend less time there than the small solutes. Gel filtration
can be used for separation of proteins and lipophilic com-
pounds. Large-scale gel-filtration columns are operated
with upward-flow elution.
(v) Affinity chromatography. This separation technique
exploits the binding specificity of biomolecules.
Enzymes, hormones, receptors, antibodies, antigens,
binding proteins, lectins, nucleic acids, vitamins, whole
cells and other components capable of specific and revers-
ible binding are amenable to highly selective affinity
purification. Column packing is prepared by linking a
binding molecule called a ligand to an insoluble support;
when sample is passed through the column, only solutes
with appreciable affinity for the ligand are retained. The
ligand must be attached to the support in such a way that
its binding properties are not seriously affected; mole-
cules called spacer arms are often used to set the ligand
away from the support and make it more accessible to the
solute. Many ready-made support-ligand preparations
are available commercially and are suitable for a wide

range of proteins. Conditions for elution depend on the
specific binding complex formed: elution usually
involves a change in pH, ionic strength or buffer compo-
sition. Enzyme proteins can be desorbed using a
compound with higher affinity for the enzyme than
the ligand, e.g. a substrate or substrate analogue. Affin-
ity chromatography using antibody ligands is called
immuno-affinity chromatography.
In this section we will consider principles of liquid chroma-
tography for separation of biological molecules such as proteins
and amino acids. Choice of stationary phase will depend to a
large extent on the type of chromatography employed; however
certain basic requirements must be met. For high capacity, the
solid support must be porous with high internal surface area; it
must also be insoluble and chemically stable during operation
and cleaning. Ideally, the particles should exhibit high mechan-
ical strength and show little or no non-specific binding. The
low rigidity of many porous gels was initially a problem in
industrial-scale chromatography; the weight of the packing
material in large columns and the pressures developed during
flow tended to compress the packing and impede operation.
However, many macroporous gels and composite materials of
high rigidity are now available for industrial use.
Two methods for carrying out chromatographic separa-
tions are high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). In principle,
any of the types of chromatography described above can be
executed using HPLC and FPLC techniques. Specialised
equipment for HPLC and FPLC allows automated injection
of sample, rapid flow of material through the column, col-
lection of the separated fractions, and data analysis.
Chromatographic separations traditionally performed under
atmospheric pressure in vertical columns with manual sample
feed and gravity elution are carried out faster and with better
resolution using densely-packed columns and high flow rates
in HPLC and FPLC systems. The differences between HPLC
and FPLC lie in the flow rates and pressures used, the size of
the packing material, and the resolution accomplished. In gen-
eral, HPLC instruments are designed for small-scale,
high-resolution analytical applications; FPLC is tailored for
large-scale purification. In order to achieve the high resolu-
tions characteristic of HPLC, stationary-phase particles
2-5 pm in diameter are commonly used. Because the particles
are so small, HPLC systems are operated under high pressure
(5-10 MPa) to achieve flow rates of 1-5 ml min -1. FPLC
instruments are not able to develop such high pressures
(1-2 MPa), and are therefore operated with column packings
of larger size. Resolution is poorer using FPLC compared withIO Unit Op

HPLC; accordingly, it is common practice to collect only the
central peak of the solute pulse emerging from the end of the
column and to recycle or discard the leading and trailing
edges. FPLC equipment is particularly suited to protein separ-
ations; many gels used for gel chromatography and af~nity
chromatography are compressible and cannot withstand the
high pressures exerted in HPLC.
Chromatography is essentially a batch operation; however
industrial chromatography systems can be monitored and con-
trolled for easy automation. Cleaning the column in place is
generally difficult. Depending on the nature of the impurities
contained in the samples, rather harsh treatments with concen-
trated salt or dilute alkali solutions are required; these may affect
swelling of the gel beads and, therefore, liquid flow in the col-
umn. Regeneration in place is necessary as re-packing of large
columns can be laborious and time-consuming. Repeated use of
chromatographic columns is essential because of their high cost.
10.7.1 Differential Migration
Differential migration provides the basis for chromatographic
separation and is explained diagrammatically in Figure 10.15.
A solution contains two solutes A and B which have different
equilibrium affinities for a particular stationary phase. For the
sake of brevity, let us say that the solutes are adsorbed onto the
stationary phase although they may be adsorbed, bound or
entrapped depending on the type of chromatography
employed. Assume that A is adsorbed more strongly than B. If
a small quantity of solution is passed through the column so
that only a limited depth of packing is saturated, both solutes
will be retained in the bed as shown in Figure 10.16(a).
A suitable eluant is now passed through the bed. As shown
in Figures 10.16(b-e), both solutes will be alternately
adsorbed and desorbed at lower positions in the column as
flow of eluant continues. Because solute B is more easily
desorbed than A, it moves forward more rapidly. Differences
in migration velocities of solutes are related to differences in
equilibrium distributions between stationary and mobile
phases. In Figure 10.16(e), solute B has been separated from A
and washed out of the system.
Several parameters are used to characterise differential
migration. An important variable is the volume Ve of eluting
solvent required to carry the solute through the column until it
emerges at its maximum concentration. Each component sep-
arated by chromatography has a different elution volume.
Another parameter commonly used to characterise elution is

Eqs (10.37) and (10.38) are normally applied to adsorption,
partition, ion-exchange and affinity chromatography. In gel
chromatography where separation is a function of effective
molecular size, the elution volume is easily related to certain
physical properties of the gel column. The total volume of a gel
column is:
Kp is a convenient parameter for comparing separation results
obtained with different gel-chromatography columns; it is
independent of column size and packing density. However
experimental determination of Kp depends on knowledge of
Vi, which is difficult to measure accurately. Vi is usually calcu-
lated using the equation:
(10.42)
VT= Vo+ Vi+ V,
(10.39)
where VT is total volume, Vo is void volume outside the par-
ticles, Vi is internal volume of liquid in the pores of the parti-
cles, and Vs is volume of the ge! itself. The outer volume Vo
can be determined by measuring the elution volume of a sub-
stance that is completely excluded from the stationary phase; a
solute which does not penetrate the gel can be washed from the
column using a volume of liquid equal to Vo. Vo is usually
about one-third VT. Solutes which are only partly excluded
from the stationary phase elute with a volume described by the
following equation:

and swollen, the value of a is unknown and Vi is determined
using the following equation:

A pilot-scale gel-chromatography column packed with Sephacryl resin is used to separate two hormones A and B. The column is
5 cm in diameter and 0 . 3 m high; the void volume is 1.9 • 10 -4 m 3. The water regain value of the gel is
3 • 10 -3 m 3 kg- 1 dry Sephacryl; the density of wet gel is 1.25 • 103 kg m -3. The partition coefficient for hormone A is 0.38;
the partition coefficient for hormone B is 0.15. If the eluant flow rate is 0.7 1 h-1, what is the retention time for each hormone?
Solution:
The total column volume is:
V T = • r2h = n (2.5 • 10 -2 m) 2 (0.3 m) = 5.89 • 10 -4 m 3.
Vo = 1.9 • 10 -4 m3; Pw = 1000 kg m -3. From Eq. (10.43):

Zone Spreading
The effectiveness of chromatography depends n o t only on
differential migration but on whether the elution bands for
individual solutes remain compact and without overlap.
Ideally, each solute should pass out of the column at a different
instant in time. In practice, elution bands spread out some-
what so that each solute takes a finite period of time to pass
across the end of the column. Zone spreading is not so import-
ant when migration rates vary widely because there is little
chance that solute peaks will overlap. However if the mole-
cules to be separated have similar structure, migration rates
will also be similar and zone spreading must be carefully con-
trolled.
As illustrated in Figure 10.15, typical chromatogram elu-
tion bands have a peak of high concentration at or about the
centre of the pulse but are of finite width as the concentration
trails off to zero before and after the peak. Spreading of the
solute peak is caused by several factors represented schemati-
cally in Figure 10.17.
(i)
Axial diffusion. As solute is carried through the column,
molecular diffusion of solute will occur from regions of
high concentration to regions of low concentration.
Diffusion in the axial direction, i.e. along the length of
the tube, is indicated in Figure 10.17(a) by broken
arrows. Axial diffusion broadens the solute peak by trans-
porting material upstream and downstream away from
the region of greatest concentration.
(ii) Eddy diffusion. In columns packed with solid particles,
actual flow paths of liquid through the bed can be highly
variable. As indicated in Figure 10.17(a), some liquid will
flow almost directly through the bed while other liquid
will take longer and more tortuous paths through the
gaps or interstices between the particles. Accordingly,
some solute molecules carried in the fluid will move slow-
er than the average rate of progress through the column
while others will take shorter paths and move ahead of the
average; the result is spreading of the solute band.
Differential motion of material due to erratic local varia-
tions in flow velocity is known as eddy diffusion.
(iii) Local non-equilibrium effects. In most columns, lack of
equilibrium is the most important factor affecting zone
spreading, although perhaps the most difficult to under-
stand. Consider the situation at position X indicated in
Figure 10.17(a). A solute pulse is passing through the col-
umn; as shown in Figure 10.17(b) concentration within
this pulse increases from the front edge to a maximum
near the centre and then decreases to zero. As the solute
pulse moves down the column, an initial gradual increase
in solute concentration will be experienced at X. In
response to this increase in mobile-phase solute concen-
tration, solute will bind to the stationary phase and the
stationary-phase concentration will start to increase
towards an appropriate equilibrium value. Equilibrium is
not established immediately however; it takes time for the
solute to undergo the mass-transfer steps from liquid to
solid as outlined in Section 10.6.4. Indeed, before
equilibrium can be established, the mobile-phase concen-
tration increases again as the centre of the solute pulse
moves closer to X. Because concentration in the mobileIo Unit Op

phase is continuously increasing, equilibrium at X
remains always out of reach and the stationary-phase
concentration lags behind equilibrium valucs. As a
consequence, a higher concentration of solute remains in
the liquid than if equilibrium were established, and the
front edge of the solute pulse effectively movcs ahead fast-
er than the remainder of the pulse. As the peak of the
solute pulse passes X, the mobile-phase concentration
starts to decrease with time. In response, the solid phase
must divest itself of solute to reach equilibrium with the
lower liquid-phase concentrations. Again, because of
delays due to mass transfer, equilibrium cannot be
established with the continuously changing liquid
concentration. As the solute pulse passes and the liquid
concentration at X falls to zero, the solid phase still con-
tains solute molecules that continue to be released into
the liquid. Consequently, the rear of the solute pulse is
effectively stretched out until the stationary phase reaches
equilibrium with the liquid.
In general, conditions which improve mass transfer will
increase the rate at which equilibrium is achieved between the
phases and minimise zone spreading. For example, increasing
(b)
the particle surface area per unit volume facilitates mass trans-
fer and reduces non-equilibrium effects; surface area is usually
increased by using smaller particles. On the other hand,
increasing the liquid flow rate will exacerbate non-equilibrium
effects as the rate of adsorption fails to keep up with con-
centration changes in the mobile phase. Viscous solutions give
rise to considerable zone broadening as a result of slower mass-
transfer rates; zone broadening is also more pronounced if the
solute molecules are large. Changes in temperature can affect
zone broadening in several ways. Because viscosity is reduced
at elevated temperatures, heating the column often decreases
zone spreading. However, rates of axial diffusion increase at
higher temperatures so that the overall effect depends on the
system and temperature range tested.
10.7.3 Theoretical Plates in Chromatography
The concept of theoretical plates is often used to analyse zone
broadening in chromatography. The idea is essentially the same
as that described in Section 10.4 for an ideal equilibrium stage.
The chromatography column is considered to be made up of a
number of segments or plates of height/-k, the magnitude of HIO Unit Operations

where His plate height, u is linear liquid velocity, and A, B and
Care experimentally-determined kinetic constants. A, B and C
include the effects of liquid-solid mass transfer, forward and
backward axial dispersion, and non-ideal distribution of liquid
around the packing. As outlined in Section 10.6.4, overall
rates of solute adsorption and desorption in chromatography
depend mainly on mass-transfer steps. Values of A, B and C
are reduced by improving mass transfer between liquid and
solid phases, resulting in a decrease in HETP and better col-
umn performance. Eq. (10.44) and other HETP models are
discussed further in other references [ 16, 17].
HETP for a particular component is related to the elution
volume and width of the solute peak as it appears on the
chromatogram. If, as shown in Figure 10.18(a), the pulse has
the standard symmetrical form of a normal distribution
around a mean value k, the number oftheoreticalplates can be
calculated as follows:

is of the same order as the diameter of the resin particles.
Within each segment equilibrium is supposed to exist.
As in adsorption operations, equilibrium is not often
achieved in chromatography so that the theoretical-plate con-
cept does not accurately reflect conditions in the column.
Nevertheless the idea of theoretical plates is applied extensive-
ly, mainly because it provides a parameter, the plate height H,
which can be used to characterise zone spreading. Use of the
plate height, which is also known as the height equivalent to a
theoreticalplate (HETP), is acceptable practice in chromatog-
raphy design even though it is based on a poor model of
column operation. HETP is a measure of zone broadening; in
general, the lower the HETP value the narrower is the solute
peak.
HETP depends on various processes which occur during
elution of a chromatography sample. A popular and simple
expression for HETP takes the form:
where N is number of theoretical plates, Ve is the distance on
the chromatogram corresponding to the elution volume of the
solute, and w is the base line width of the peak between lines
drawn tangent to the inflection points of the curve. Eq.
(10.45) applies if the sample is introduced into the column as a
narrow pulse. Number of theoretical plates is related to HETP
as follows:
L
N
H
(10.46)
where L is the length of the column. For a given column, the
greater the number of theoretical plates the greater is the num-
ber of ideal equilibrium stages in the system and the more
efficient is the separation. Values of H and Nvary for a parti-
cular column depending on the component being separated.
10.7.4
Resolution
Resolution is a measure of zone overlap in chromatography
and an indicator of column efficiency. For separation of two
components, resolution is given by the following equation:IO Unit Operations
~4 8
2(Ve2 - Vel)
R N
=
(W 1 + W2)
(10.47)
where R N is resolution, Vel and Ve2 are distances on the
chromatogram corresponding to elution volumes for compo-
nents 1 and 2, and wI and w2 the baseline widths of the
chromatogram peaks as shown in Figure 10.18(b). Column
resolution is a dimensionless quantity; the greater the value of
RNthe more separated are the two solute peaks. An RNvalue
of 1.5 corresponds to a baseline resolution of 99.8% or virtual
complete separation; when RN = 1.0 the two peaks overlap by
about 2% of the total peak area.
Column resolution can be expressed in terms of HETP.
Assuming wI and w2 are approximately equal, Eq. (10.47)
becomes:
10.7.5
( V e 2 - Vel)
R N

RN= u J)V

(10.38), so that Eq. (10.49) becomes:

Using the expression for Nfrom Eq. (10.46), the equation for

increases with decreasing HETP; therefore, any enhancement
of mass-transfer conditions reducing H will improve resolu-
tion. Derivation of Eq. (10.51) involves Eq. (10.45), which
applies to chromatography systems where a relatively small
quantity of sample is injected rapidly. Resolution is sensitive to
increases in sample size; as the amount of sample increases, res-
olution declines. In laboratory analytical work it is common to
use extremely small sample volumes, of the order of micro-
litres. However, depending on the type of chromatography
used for production-scale purification, sample volumes
5-20% of the column volume and higher are used. Because
resolution under these conditions is relatively poor, if the
solute peak is collected for isolation of product the central
portion of the peak is retained while the leading and trailing
edges are recycled back to the feed.

As is apparent from Eq. (10.51), peak resolution increases as a

Scaling-Up Chromatography
The aim in scale-up of chromatography is to retain the resolu-
tion and solute recovery achieved using a small-scale column
while increasing the throughput of material. Strategies for
scale up must take into account the dominance of mass-
transfer effects in chromatography separations.
The easiest approach to scale-up is to simply increase the
flow rate through the column. This gives unsatisfactory
results; raising the liquid velocity increases zone spreading and
produces high pressures in the column which compress the
stationary phase and cause pumping difficulties. The pressure-
drop problem can be alleviated by increasing the particle size;
however this hinders the overall mass-transfer process and so
decreases resolution. Increasing the column length can help
regain any resolution lost by increasing the flow rate or particle
diameter; however increasing L also has a strong effect in rais-
ing the pressure drop through the column.
The solution to scale-up is to keep the same column length,
linear flow velocity and particle size as in the small column, but
increase the column diameter. The larger capacity of the col-
umn is therefore due solely to its greater cross-sectional area.
Sample volume and volumetric flow rate are increased in pro-
portion to column volume. In this way, all the important
parameters affecting the packing matrix, liquid flow, mass
transfer and equilibrium conditions are kept constant; similar
column performance can therefore be expected. Because
liquid distribution in large-diameter packed columns tends to
be poor, care must be taken to ensure liquid is fed evenly over
the entire column cross-section.
In practice, variations in column properties and efficiency do
occur with scale-up. As an example, compressible solids such as
those used in gel chromatography get better support from the249

column wall in small columns than in large columns; as a result,
lower linear flow rates must be used in large-scale systems. An
advantage of using gels of high mechanical strength in laborato-
ry systems is that they allow more direct scale-up to commercial
operation. The elasticity and compressibility of gels used for
fractionation of high-molecular-weight proteins preclude use of
long columns in large-scale processes; bed heights in these
systems are normally restricted to 0.6-1.0 m.

(b) Determine the compressibility for each culture.
(c) A filter press with area 15 m 2 is used to process 20 m 3 fila-
mentous S. griseus culture. If the filtration must be
completed in one hour, what pressure drop is required?
10.3 Rotary-drum vacuum filtration
Continuous rotary vacuum filtration can be analysed by con-
sidering each revolution of the drum as a stationary batch
filtration. Per revolution, each cm 2 of filter cloth is used to
form cake only for the period of time it spends submerged in
the liquid reservoir. A rotary-drum vacuum filter with drum
diameter 1.5 m and filter width 1.2 m is used to filter starch
from an aqueous slurry. The pressure drop is kept constant at
4.5 psi; the filter operates with 30% of the filter cloth sub-
merged. Resistance due to the filter medium is negligible.
Laboratory tests with a 5 cm 2 filter have shown that 500 ml
slurry can be filtered in 23.5 min at a pressure drop of 12 psi;
the starch cake was also found to be compressible with s = 0.57.
Use the following steps to determine the drum speed required
to produce 20 m 3 filtered liquid per hour.
(a) Evaluate ~fa'cfrom the laboratory test data.
(b) If Nis the drum speed in revolutions per hour, what is the
cycle time?

achieve the desired rate of 20 m 3 per hour?
(e) Apply Eq. (10.11) to a single revolution of the drum to
evaluate N.

filter area increases from 30% to 50%. What drum speed
is required under these conditions?

sity of the suspending fluid is 0.997 g cm -3. 500 litres broth

Centrifugation
of food particles
Small food particles with diameter 10 -2 mm and density
1.03 g cm -3 are suspended in liquid of density 1.00 g cm -3.
The viscosity of the liquid is 1.25 mPa s. A tubular-bowl cen-
trifuge of length 70 cm and radius 11.5 cm is used to separate
the particles. If the centrifuge is operated at 10 000 rpm, esti-
mate the feed flow rate at which the food particles are just
removed from the suspension.

trifuge is to be used for industrial treatment of 80 litres min- 1,

mentation performance if the larger centrifuge contains 55

A tubular-bowl centrifuge is used to concentrate a suspension

protein. At a speed of 12 000 rpm, the centrifuge treats 3 1

same centrifuge to separate cell debris from homogenate pro- "
duced by mechanical disruption of the yeast. If the average size
of the debris is one-third that of the yeast and the viscosity of
the homogenate is five times greater than the cell suspension,
what flow rate can be handled if the centrifuge is operated at
the same speed?

aqueous partitioning
Leucine dehydrogenase is recovered from a homogenate of
disrupted Bacillus cereus cells using an aqueous two-phase

initially containing 3.2 units enzyme ml-1 are processed; a
polyethylene glycol-salt mixture is added and two phases

10.10 Recovery of viral particles
Cells of the fall armyworm Spodopterafrugiperda are cultured
in a fermenter to produce viral particles for insecticide. Viral
particles are released into the culture broth after lysis of the
host cells. The initial culture volume is 5 litres. An aqueous
two-phase polymer solution of volume 2 litres is added to this
liquid; the volume of the bottom phase is 1 litre. The virus par-
tition coefficient is 10 -2.

Gel chromatography is to be used for commercial-scale
purification of a proteinaceous diphtheria toxoid from
Corynebacterium diphtheriae supernatant. In the laboratory, a
small column of 1.5 cm inner diameter and height 0.4 m is
packed with 10 g dry Sephadex gel; the void volume is meas-
ured as 23 ml. A sample containing the toxoid and impurities
is injected into the column. At a liquid flow rate of
14 ml min-1, the elution volume for the toxoid is 29 ml; the
elution volume for the principal impurity is 45 ml. A column
of height 0.6 m and diameter 0.5 m is available for large-scale
gel chromatography. The same type of packing is used; the
void fraction and ratio of pore volume to total bed volume
remain the same as in the bench-scale column. The liquid flow
rate in the large column is scaled up in proportion to the col-
umn cross-sectional area; the flow patterns in both columns
can be assumed identical. The water regain value for the pack-
ing is given by the manufacturer as 0.0035 m 3 kg- 1 dry gel.

principal impurity?

Human insulin A and B from recombinant Escherichia coli are
separated using pilot-scale af~nity chromatography.
Laboratory studies have shown that capacity factors for the
proteins are 0.85 for the A-chain and 1.05 for the B-chain.
The dependence of HETP on liquid velocity satisfies the fol-
lowing type of equation:

The heart of a typical bioprocess is the reactor or fermenter. Flanked by unit operations which carry outphysical changes for
medium preparation and recovery ofproducts, the reactor is where the major chemical and biochemical transformations
occur. In many bioprocesses, characteristics of the reaction determine to a large extent the economic feasibility of the project.
Of most interest in biological systems are catalytic reactions.
By definition, a catalyst is a substance which affects the rate of
reaction without altering the reaction equilibrium or under-
going permanent change itself. Enzymes, enzyme complexes,
cell organelles and whole cells perform catalytic roles; the latter
may be viable or non-viable, growing or non-growing.
Biocatalysts can be of microbial, plant or animal origin. Cell
growth is an autocatalytic reaction: this means that the catalyst
is a product of the reaction. The performance of catalytic reac-
tions is characterised by variables such as the reaction rate and
yield of product from substrate. These parameters must be
taken into account when designing and operating reactors.
In engineering analysis of catalytic reactions, a distinction
is made between homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. A
reaction is homogeneous if the temperature and all concentra-
tions in the system are uniform. Most fermentations and
enzyme reactions carried out in mixed vessels fall into this cat-
egory. In contrast, heterogeneous reactions take place in the
presence of concentration or temperature gradients. Analysis
of heterogeneous reactions requires application of mass-
transfer principles in conjunction with reaction theory.
Heterogeneous reactions are treated in Chapter 12.
This chapter covers the basic aspects of reaction theory
which allow us to quantify the extent and speed of homo-
geneous reactions and to identify important factors affecting
reaction rate.
11.1 Basic Reaction Theory
Reaction theory has two fundamental parts: reaction thermody-
namics and reaction kinetics. Reaction thermodynamics is
concerned with how far the reaction can proceed; no matter
how fast a reaction is, it cannot continue beyond the point of
chemical equilibrium. On the other hand, reaction kinetics is
concerned with the rate at which reactions proceed.
11.1.1 Reaction Thermodynamics
Consider a reversible reaction represented by the following
equation:
A+ bB ~ y Y + z Z .
(11.1)
A, B, Y and Z are chemical species; b, yand zare stoichiometric
coefficients. If the components are left in a closed system for an
infinite period of time, the reaction proceeds until thermody-
namic equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium there is no net
driving force for further change; the reaction has reached the
limit of its capacity for chemical transformation in a closed
system. Composition of the equilibrium mixture is deter-
mined exclusively by the thermodynamic properties of the
reactants and products; it is independent of the way the reac-
tion is executed. Equilibrium concentrations are related by the
equilibrium constant, K For the reaction of Eq. (11.1):

where A G ~xnis the change in standardfree energy per mole of A

1 atm pressure and 25~ however, for biochemical reactions
occurring in solution, other standard conditions may be used

(b) As Kincreases, the fraction of fructose in the equilibrium mixture increases. Therefore, from an equilibrium point of view,
it is more desirable to operate the reactor at 75~ However, other factors such as enzyme deactivation at high temperatures
should also be considered.II HomogeneousReactions

A limited number of commercially-important enzyme conver-
sions, such as glucose isomerisation and starch hydrolysis, are
treated as reversible reactions. In these systems, the reaction
mixture at equilibrium contains significant amounts of reac-
tants as well as products. However, for many reactions A Grxn is
negative and large in magnitude. As a result, K is also very
large, the reaction favours the products rather than the reac-
tants, and the reaction is regarded as irreversible. Most enzyme
and cell reactions fall into this category. For example, the equi-
librium constant for sucrose hydrolysis by invertase is about
104; for fermentation of glucose to ethanol and carbon diox-
ide, K is about 1030. The equilibrium ratio of products to
reactants is so overwhelmingly large for these reactions that
they are considered to proceed to completion, i.e. the reaction
stops only when the concentration of one of the reactants falls
to zero. Equilibrium thermodynamics has therefore only lim-
ited application to enzyme and cell reactions. Moreover, the
thermodynamic principles outlined in this section apply only
to closed systems; true thermodynamic equilibrium does not
exist in living cells which exchange matter with their sur-
roundings. Metabolic processes in cells are in a dynamic state;
products formed are constantly removed or broken down so
that reactions are driven forward. Most reactions in biological
systems proceed to completion in a finite period of time at a
finite rate.
If we know that complete conversion will eventually take
place, the most useful reaction parameter to know is the rate at
which the transformation proceeds. Another important char-
acteristic, especially for systems in which many different
reactions take place at the same time, is the proportion of reac-
tant that is converted to the desired products. These properties
of reactions are discussed in the remainder of this chapter.
o
11.1.2 Reaction Yield
The extent to which reactants are converted to products is
expressed as the reaction yield. Generally speaking, yield is the
amount of product formed or accumulated per amount of
reactant provided or consumed. Unfortunately, there is no
strict definition of yield; several different yield parameters are
applicable in different situations. The terms used to express
yield in this text do not necessarily have universal acceptance
and are defined here for our convenience. Be prepared for
other books to use different definitions.
Consider the simple enzyme reaction:
L-histidine --~ urocanic acid + N H 3
(11.7)
catalysed by histidase. According to the reaction stoichiometry,
1 gmol urocanic acid is produced for each gmol L-histidine
consumed; the yield of urocanic acid from histidine is there-
fore 1 gmol gmo1-1. However, let us assume that the histidase
used in this reaction is contaminated with another enzyme,
histidine decarboxylase. Histidine decarboxylase catalyses the
following reaction:
L-histidine --> histamine + C O 2.
(11.8)
If both enzymes are active, some L-histidine will react with
histidase according to Eq. (11.7), while some will be
decarboxylated according to Eq. (11.8). After addition of the
enzymes to the substrate, analysis of the reaction mixture
shows that 1 gmol urocanic acid and 1 gmol histamine are
produced for every 2 gmol histidine consumed. The observed
or apparent yield of urocanic acid from L-histidine is
1 gmol/2 gmol = 0.5 gmol gmo1-1. The observed yield of
0.5 gmol gmo1-1 is different from the stoichiometric, true or
theoretical yield of 1 gmol gmo1-1 calculated from reaction
stoichiometry because the reactant was channelled in two
separate reaction pathways. An analogous situation arises if
product rather that reactant is consumed in other reactions;
the observed yield of product would be lower than the theoret-
ical yield. When reactants or products are involved in additional
reactions, the observed yield may be different~om the theoretical
yield.
The above analysis leads to two useful definitions of yield for
reaction systems:
(total mass or moles of)
/true, stoichiometric or] =
product formed
k theoreticalyield J (mass or moles of reactant used
kt~ form that particular product ]
(11.9)
and
observed or ~
(massor moles of product present )
apparent yield] = ( t~176176176
)consumed
(11.10)
There is a third type of yield applicable in certain situations.
For reactions with incomplete conversion of reactant, it may
be of interest to specify the amount of product formed per
amount of reactant provided to the reaction rather than actually
consumed. For example, consider the isomerisation reaction
catalysed by glucose isomerase:II Homogeneous Reactions
glucose ~

fructose.
(11.11)
The reaction is carried out in a closed reactor with pure
enzyme. At equilibrium the sugar mixture contains 5 5 mol%
glucose and 45 mol% fructose. The theoretical yield of
fructose from glucose is 1 gmol gmo1-1 because, from
stoichiometry, formation of 1 gmol fructose requires 1 gmol
glucose. The observedyieldwould also be 1 gmol gmo1-1 if the
reaction occurs in isolation. However if the reaction is started
with glucose present only, the equilibrium yield of fructose
per gmol glucose added to the reactor is 0.45 gmol gmo1-1.
This type of yield for incomplete reactions may be denoted
grossyield.
Example 11.2 Incomplete enzyme reaction
An enzyme catalyses the reaction:
A~-B.
At equilibrium, the reaction mixture contains 63 wt% A.
(a) What is the equilibrium constant?
(b) If the reaction starts with A only, what is the equilibrium yield of B from A?
Solution:
(a) From stoichiometry the molecular weights of A and B must be equal: therefore wt% - mol%. From Eq. (11.2):
K_CBo
Using a basis of I gmol l-l, CAe is 0.63 gmol l-1 and CBe is 0.37 gmol l-1. The value of Ktherefore is 0"37/0.63= 0.59.
(b) From stoichiometry, the true yield of B from A is 1 gmol gmol- 1 However the gross yield is 0"37/1 - 0.37 gmol gmol-1

11.1.3 Reaction Rate
Consider the general irreversible reaction:
a A + bB ---> y Y + z Z .
(11.12)
The rate of this reaction can be represented by the rate of conver-
sion of compound A; let us use the symbol RA to denote the rate
ofreaction with respecttoA. RA has units of, for example kg s-1.
How do we measure reaction rates? For a general reaction
system, rate of reaction is related to rate of change of mass in
the system by the unsteady-state mass-balance equation
derived in Chapter 6:
dM
-
dt
a:.
(6.5)
In Eq (6.5), M is mass, t is time, M i is mass flow rate into the

"
system, AT/ois mass flow rate out of the system, RG is mass rate
of generation by reaction and Re is mass rate of consumption
by reaction9 Let us apply Eq. (6.5) to compound A, assuming
that the reaction of Eq. (11.12) is the only reaction taking
place that involves A. Rate of consumption RC is equal to RA,
and RG - 0. The mass-balance equation becomes:
d , vA
d,
M o-
(11.13)
Therefore, rate of reaction RA can be determined ifwe measure
the rate of change in mass ofA, dmA/de and the rates of flow of
A in and out of the system,Mm and MAo. In a closed system
where/~Ai = AT/Ao= 0, Eq. (11.13) becomes:

and reaction rate is measured simply by monitoring the change
in mass of A in the system. Most measurements of reaction rate
are carried out in closed systems so that the data can be analysed
according to Eq. (11.14).
is negative when A is con-
sumed by reaction; therefore the minus sign in Eq. (11.14) is
necessary to make RA a positive quantity. Rate of reaction is
sometimes called reaction velocity. Reaction velocity can also be
measured in terms of components B, Y or Z. In a closed system:

(11.15)
where M B, My and M m are masses of B, Y and Z, respectively.
When reporting reaction rate, the reactant being monitored
should be specified. Because Ry and Rm are based on product
accumulation, these reaction rates are called production rates or
productivity.
Eqs (11.14) and (11.15) define the rate of reaction in a
closed system. However, reaction rate can be expressed using
different measurement bases. In bioprocess engineering there
are three distinct ways of expressing reaction rate which can be
applied in different situations.
Total rate. Total reaction rate is defined in Eqs (11.14)
and (11.15) and is expressed as either mass or moles per
unit time. Total rate is useful for specifying the output of a
particular reactor or manufacturing plant. Production
rates for factories are often expressed as total rates; for
example: 'The production rate is 100 000 tonnes per year'.
If additional reactors are built so that the reaction volume
in the plant is increased, then clearly the total reaction rate
would increase. Similarly, if the amount of cells or enzyme
used in each reactor were also increased, then the total pro-
duction rate would be improved even further.
(ii) Volumetric rate. Because the total mass of reactant con-
verted in a reaction mixture depends on the size of the
system, it is often convenient to specify reaction rate as
the rate per unit volume. Units of volumetric rate are, e.g.
kg m -3 s-1. Rate of reaction expressed on a volumetric
basis is used to account for differences in volume between
reaction systems. Therefore, if the reaction mixture in a
closed system has volume V.
(i)
~A m
where CA is the concentration of A in units of, e.g.
kg m-3. Volumetric rates are particularly useful for com-
paring the performance of reactors of different size. A
common objective in optimising reaction processes is to
maximise volumetric productivity so that the desired
total production rate can be achieved with reactors of
minimum size and therefore minimum cost.
(iii) Specific rate. Biological reactions involve enzyme and cell
catalysts. Because the total rate of conversion depends on
the amount of catalyst present, it is sometimes useful to
specify reaction rate as the rate per quantity of enzyme or
cells involved in the reaction. In a closed system, specific
reaction rate can be measured as follows:
rA=--
or
dtt
(11.18)
where rA is the specific rate of reaction with respect to A, X
is the quantity of cells, E is the quantity of enzyme and
dMA/dt is the rate of change of mass of A in the system. As
quantity of cells is usually expressed as mass, units of spe-
cific rate for a cell-catalysed reaction would be, e.g. kg
(kg cells)-1 S-1 or simply s-1. On the other hand, the
mass of a particular enzyme added to a reaction is rarely
known; most commercial enzyme preparations contain
several components in unknown and variable proportions
depending on the batch obtained from the manufacturer.
To overcome these difficulties, enzyme quantity is often
expressed as units of activity measured under specified
conditions. One unit of enzyme is usually taken as the
amount which catalyses conversion of I pmol substrate
per minute at the optimal temperature, pH and substrate
concentration. Therefore, if E in Eq. (11.18) is expressed
as units of enzyme activity, the specific rate of reaction
under process conditions could be reported as, e.g. kg
(unit enzyme) -1 s-1. In a closed system where the
volume of reaction mixture remains constant, an alterna-
tive expression for specific reaction rate is:
RA _ - 1 d M A

rA -- --

(11.19)
where rA is the volumetric rate of reaction with respect to
A. When V is constant, Eq. (11.16) can be written:
where x is cell concentration and e is enzyme concentration.z6z

Volumetric and total rates are not a direct reflection of cata-
lyst performance; this is represented by the specific rate.
Specific rates are employed when comparing different cells or
enzymes. Specific rate is the rate achieved per unit catalyst and,
under usual circumstances, is not dependent on the size of the
system or the amount of catalyst present. Some care is necessary
when interpreting results for reaction rate. For example, if two
fermentations are carried out with different cell lines and the
volumetric rate of reaction is greater in the first fermentation
than in the second, you should not jump to the conclusion that
the cell line in the first experiment is 'better', or capable of
greater metabolic activity. It could be that the faster volumetric
rate is due to the first fermenter being operated at a higher cell
density than the second, leading to measurement of a more
rapid rate per unit volume. Different strains of organism
should be compared in terms of specific reaction rates.
Total, volumetric and specific productivities are inter-
related concepts in process design. For example, high total
productivity could be achieved with a catalyst of low specific
activity if the reactor is loaded with a high catalyst concentra-
tion. If this is not possible, the volumetric productivity will be
relatively low and a larger reactor is required to achieve the
desired total productivity. In this book, the symbol RA will be
used to denote total reaction rate with respect to component
A; rA represents either volumetric or specific rate.
1 1.1.4
influence reaction rate, such as temperature. When the kinetic
equation has the form of Eq. (11.20), the reaction is said to be
of order awith respect to component A and order b with respect
to B. The order ofthe overall reaction is (a+ b). It is not usually
possible to predict the order of reactions from stoichiometry.
The mechanism of single reactions and the functional form of
the kinetic expression must be determined by experiment. The
dimensions and units of k depend on the order of the reaction.

Temperature has a significant kinetic effect on reactions.
Variation of the rate constant k with temperature is described
by the Arrhenius equation:
k=Ae-

(11.21)
where k is the rate constant, A is the Arrhenius constant or.~e-
quencyfactor, Eis the activation energy for the reaction, R is the
ideal gas constant, and Tis absolute temperature. Values of R
are listed in Table 2.5 (p. 20). According to the Arrhenius
equation, as Tincreases, k increases exponentially. Taking the
natural logarithm of both sides of Eq. (11.21):
In k - In A -
Reaction Kinetics
As reactions proceed, the concentrations of reactants decrease.
In general, rate of reaction depends on reactant concentration
so that the specific rate of conversion decreases simultaneous:
ly. Reaction rate also varies with temperature; most reactions
speed up considerably as the temperature rises. Reaction
kinetics refers to the relationship between rate of reaction and
conditions which affect reaction velocity, such as reactant
concentration and temperature. These relationships are con-
veniently described using kinetic expressions or kinetic
equations.
Consider again the general irreversible reaction of Eq.
(11.12). Often but not always, the volumetric rate of this reac-
tion can be expressed as a function of reactant concentrations
using the following mathematical form:
r =kqq
(11.20)
where k is the rate constant or rate coefficient for the reaction. By
definition, the rate constant is independent of the concentra-
tion of reacting species but is dependent on other variables that

Thus, a plot of In k v e r s u s 1/T gives a straight line with slope
-E/R . For many reactions the value of E is positive and large,
indicating a rapid increase in reaction rate with temperature.
11.2 Calculation of Reaction Rates From
Experimental Data
As outlined in Section 11.1.3, the volumetric rate of reaction
in a closed system can be found by measuring the rate of
change in the mass of reactant present, provided the reactant is
involved in only one reaction. Most kinetic studies of biolog-
ical reactions are carried out in closed systems with a constant
volume of reaction mixture; therefore, Eq. (11.17) can be used
to evaluate the volumetric reaction rate. The concentration of
a particular reactant or product is measured as a function of
time. For a reactant such as A in Eq. (11.12), the results will be
similar to those shown in Figure 11.1(a); the concentration
will decrease with time. The volumetric rate of reaction is
equal to dCA/dt, which can be evaluated as the slope of aI I HomogeneousReactions

smooth curve drawn through the data points. The slope of the
curve in Figure 11.1 (a) changes with time; the reaction rate is
greater at the beginning of the experiment than at the end.
One obvious way to determine reaction rate is to draw tan-
gents to the curve of Figure 11. l(a) at various times and evaluate
the slopes of the tangents; this is shown in Figure 11.1(b). Ifyou
have ever attempted this you will know that it can be extremely
difficult, even though correct in principle. Drawing tangents to
curves is a highly subjective procedure prone to great inaccur-
acy, even with special drawing devices designed for the purpose.
The results depend strongly on the way the data are smoothed
and the appearance of the curve at the points chosen. More reli-
able techniques are available for graphical differentiation of rate
data. Graphical differentiation is valid only if the data can be
presumed to differentiate smoothly.
11.2.1 Average Rate-Equal Area Method
This technique for determining rates is based on the average
rate-equal area construction, and will be illustrated using data
for oxygen uptake by immobilised cells. Results from measure-
ment of oxygen concentration in a closed system as a function
of time are listed in the first two columns of Table 11.1.
(i)
Tabulate values of A CA and At for each time interval as
shown in Table 11.1. A CA values are negative because CA
decreases over each interval.

A disadvantage of the average rate-equal area method is that it
is not easily applied if the data show scatter. If the concentra-
tion measurements are not very accurate, the horizontal lines
representing aG/Atmay be located as shown in Figure 11.3.
If we were to draw a curve equalising areas at each ACA/Atline,
the rate curve would show complex behaviour oscillating up
and down as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 11.3.
Experience suggests that this is not a realistic representation of
reaction rate. Because of the inaccuracies in measured data, we
need several concentration measurements to define a change
in rate. The data of Figure 11.3 are better represented using a
smooth curve to equalise as far as possible the areas above and
below adjacent groups of horizontal lines. For data showing
even greater scatter, it may be necessary to average consecutive
pairs oflXCA/zXtval'ues tO simplify graphical analysis.

(iii) In the mid-point slope method, rates are calculated mid-
way between two adjacent intervals of size e. Therefore,
the first rate determination is made for t = 1 min.
Calculate the differences [(CA)t+e -- (CA)t-e] from
Figure 11.4, where (CA)t+e denotes the concentration of
A at time t+ e, and (CA) t-e denotes the concentration at

taken from the list of original data but are read from the
Ifa reaction obeys zero-order kinetics, the reaction rate is inde-
pendent of reactant concentration. The kinetic expression is:
r =k0
(11.24)
where ra is the volumetric rate of reaction with respect to A and
k o is the zero-order rate constant, k o as defined in Eq. (11.24) is a
volumetric rate constant with units of, e.g. kgmol m -3 s -1.
Because the volumetric rate of a catalytic reaction depends on
the amount of catalyst present, when Eq. (11.24) is used to rep-
resent the rate of a cell or enzyme reaction, the value of k0
includes the effect of catalyst concentration as well as the
specific rate of reaction. We could write:
ko= k~ e or ko= k~ x
(11.25)
where k6 is the specific zero-order rate constant for enzyme
reaction and e is the concentration of enzyme. Corres-
pondingly, for cell reaction, k~ is the specific zero-order rate
constant and xis cell concentration.]I HomogeneousReactions

Let us assume we have collected concentration data for a
particular reaction, and wish to determine the appropriate
kinetic constant. If the reaction takes place in a closed, con-
stant-volume system, rate of reaction can be evaluated directly
as the rate of change in reactant concentration using the meth-
ods for graphical differentiation described in Section 11.2.
From Eq. (11.24), if the reaction is zero-order the rate will be
constant and equal to k0 at all times during the reaction.
Because the kinetic expression for zero-order reactions is rela-
tively simple, rather than differentiate the concentration data
it is easier to integrate Eq. (11.24) with rA - -dC^/dt to obtain
Example
1 1.3
an equation for CA as a function of time. The experimental
data can then be checked directly against the integrated equa-
tion. Integrating Eq. (11.24) with initial condition CA - CA0
at t - 0 gives:
CA= f-rA dt = CAo- kot.
(11.26)
Therefore, when the reaction is zero order, a plot of CA versus
time gives a straight line with slope - k 0. Application of Eq.
(11.26) is illustrated in Example 11.3.

The zero-order model fits the data well. The slope is - 6 . 7 • 10 -3 mmol 1-1 min-1; therefore, k0 = 6.7 • 10 -3 mmol 1-1

(b) For cells of the same age cultured under the same conditions, from Eq. (11.25), k0 can be expected to be directly propor-
tional to the number of cells present. Therefore, at a cell concentration of 12 g l-1:
1 2 g l -1
k0 = 22"7g 1-1 (6.7• 10-3mmol 1-1 m i D - l ) = 3.5X 10-3 mmol 1-1 miD - 1
11.3.2
First-Order Kinetics
If a reaction obeys first-order kinetics, the relationship
between reaction rate and reactant concentration is as follows:
rA=
follows first-order kinetics, we first integrate Eq. (11.27) with
rA - -dCA/dt, and then check the measured concentration data
against the resulting equation. Separating variables and inte-
grating Eq. (11.27) with initial condition CA = CA0 at t - 0
gives:
A1CA
(11 9
where rA is the volumetric rate of reaction and k1 is the first-
order rate constant with dimensions T -1. Like the zero-order
constant of the previous section, the value of k I depends on the
catalyst concentration.
Let us assume we follow the progress of a particular reaction
in a closed, constant-volume system by measuring the concen-
tration of reactant A as a function of time. Under these
conditions, rA = -dCA/dt. To determine whether the reaction
CA =CAo e-k't
(11.28)
Taking natural logarithms of both sides:
In CA = In CA0- k1 t.
(11.29)
Therefore, for first-order reaction, a plot of In CA versus time
gives a straight line with slope - k1.

11.3.3 Michaelis-Menten Kinetics
The kinetics of most enzyme reactions are reasonably well rep-
resented by the Michaelis-Menten equation:
VmaCA
~A
Km+q
(11.30)
where rA is the volumetric rate of reaction, CA is the concentra-
tion of reactant A, Vmax is the maximum rate of reaction at
infinite reactant concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant
for reactant A. Vmax has the same dimensions as rA; Km has the
same dimensions as CA. Typical units for Vmax are
k g m o l m -3 s-I; typical units for Km are k g m o l m - 3 . As
defined in Eq. (11.30), Vmax is a volumetric rate proportional to
the amount of active enzyme present. The Michaelis constant
Km is equal to the reactant concentration at which rA = Vmax/2.
Km values for some enzyme-substrate systems are listed in
Table 11.3. Km and other enzyme properties depend on the
source of the enzyme.
If we adopt conventional symbols for biological reactions
and call reactant A the substrate, Eq. (11.30) can be rewritten
in the familiar form:
V
m
Vma x $
Km+s
(11.31)
where v is the volumetric rate of reaction and s is the substrate
concentration. The biochemical basis of the Michaelis-Menten
equation will not be covered here; discussion of enzyme
reaction models and assumptions involved in derivation of
Eq. (11.31) can be found in biochemistry texts [2, 3]. Suffice it
to say here that the simplest reaction sequence which accounts
for the kinetic properties of many enzymes is:x1 HomogeneousReactions

where E is enzyme, S is substrate and P is product. ES is the
enzyme-substrate complex. Binding of substrate to the enzyme
in the first step is considered reversible with forward reaction
constant k1 and reverse reaction constant k_l. Decomposition
of the enzyme-substrate complex to give the product is an irre-
versible reaction with rate constant k2; k2 is known as the
turnover number. Analysis of this reaction sequence yields the
relationship:Therefore, at high substrate concentrations, the reaction rate
approaches a constant value independent of substrate concen-
tration; in this concentration range, the reaction is essentially
zero orderwith respect to substrate. On the other hand, at low
substrate concentrations s << Km, the value of s in the denomi-
nator of Eq. (11.31) is negligible compared with Km, and Eq.
(11.31) can be simplified to:
Vmax=k2
(11.33)
where ea is the concentration of active enzyme. As expected in
catalytic reactions, enzyme E is recovered at the end of the
reaction.
An essential feature of Michaelis-Menten kinetics is that
the catalyst becomes saturated at high substrate concentra-
tions. Figure 11.5 shows the form of Eq. (11.31); reaction rate
v does not increase indefinitely with substrate concentration
but approaches a limit, Vmax. At high substrate concentrations
s >> Km, Km in the denominator of Eq. (11.31) is negligibly
small compared with s so we can write:

The ratio of constants Vm~lKmis, in effect, a first-order rate
coefficient for the reaction. Therefore, at low substrate
concentrations there is an approximate linear dependence
of reaction rate on s; in this concentration range Michaelis-
Menten reactions are essentially first orderwith respect to sub-
strate.
The Michaelis-Menten equation is a satisfactory descrip-
tion of the kinetics of many industrial enzymes, although there
are exceptions such as glucose isomerase and amyloglucosi-
dase. More complex kinetic expressions must be applied if
there are multiple substrates or inhibition effects [2-4].
Procedures for checking whether a particular reaction follows
Michaelis-Menten kinetics and for evaluating Vmax and Km
from experimental data are described in Section 11.4.

at time zero. Initial rates and corresponding initial substrate
concentrations are used as (v, s) pairs which can then be plot-

Initial rate data are preferred for enzyme reactions because
experimental conditions such as enzyme and substrate concen-
trations are known most accurately at the start of the reaction.

because of the difficulty of extrapolating to Vmax.

pH has a pronounced effect on enzyme kinetics, as illustrat-

optimal pH and declines sharply if the pH is moved either side
of the optimum value. Kinetic equations have been developed
to describe the effect of pH on enzyme activity; however, the
influence of pH is usually determined experimentally. Ionic
strength and water activity also have considerable influence on
rate of enzyme reaction but few correlations are available for
prediction of these effects.
11.4 Determining Enzyme Kinetic
Constants From Batch Data
To fully specify the kinetics of Michaelis-Menten reactions,
two rate constants, Vmax and Km, must be evaluated.
Estimating kinetic parameters for Michaelis-Menten reac-
tions is not as straightforward as for zero- and first-order
reactions. Several graphical methods are available; unfortu-
nately some do not give accurate results.
The first step in kinetic analysis of enzyme reactions is to
obtain data for rate of reaction v as a function ofsubstrate con-
centration s. Rates of reaction can be determined from batch
concentration data as described in Section 11.2. Typically,
only initial rate data are used. This means that several batch
experiments are carried out with different initial substrate con-
centrations; from each set of data the reaction rate is evaluated

(11.37)
so that a pl0t o f 1/v versus 1/s should give a straight line with
slope Km/vm~ and intercept l/vmax. This double-reciprocal
plot is known as the Lineweaver-Burk plot, and is frequently
found in the literature on enzyme kinetics. However, the lin-
earisation process used in this method distorts the
experimental error in v (see Section 3.3.4) so that these errors
are amplified at low substrate concentrations. As a conse-
quence, the Lineweaver-Burk plot often gives inaccurate
results and is therefore not recommended [3].

According to Eq. (11.38), a plot of % versus v gives a straight
line with slope -I/Km and intercept VmaX/Km;this is called the
Eadie-Hofitee plot. As with the Lineweaver-Burk plot, the
Eadie-Hofstee linearisation distorts errors in the data so that
the method has reduced accuracy.

Multiplying Eq. (11.37) by s produces the linearised form of
the Michaelis-Menten equation according to Langmuir:

(11.39)
Therefore, a Langmuirplot of s/v versus s should give a straight
line with slope l/ Vmax and intercept Km/Vmax" Linearisation of
data for the Langmuir plot minimises distortions in experi-
mental error. Accordingly, its use for evaluation of Vmax and
Km is recommended [6].
1 1.4.5
Direct Linear Plot
A different method for plotting enzyme kinetic data has been
proposed by Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden [7]. For each
observation, reaction rate v is plotted on the vertical axis
against s on the negative horizontal axis. This is shown in
Figure 11.9 for four pairs of (v, s) data. A straight line is then
drawn to join corresponding (-s, v) points. In the absence of
experimental error, lines for each (-s, v) pair intersect at a
unique point, (Km, Vmax).When real data containing errors are
plotted, a family of intersection points is obtained. Each inter-
section gives one estimate of Vmax and Km; the median or
middle Vmax and Km values are taken as the kinetic parameters
for the reaction. This method is relatively insensitive to indi-
vidual erroneous readings which may be far from the correct
values. However a disadvantage of the procedure is that devia-
tions from Michaelis-Menten behaviour are not easily
detected. It is recommended therefore for enzymes which are
known to obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
11.5
Kinetics of Enzyme
Deactivation
Enzymes are protein molecules of complex configuration that
can be destabilised by relatively weak forces. In the course of
enzyme-catalysed reactions, enzyme deactivation occurs at a
rate which is dependent on the structure of the enzyme and the
reaction conditions. Environmental factors affecting enzyme
stability include temperature, pH, ionic strength, mechanical
forces and presence of denaturants such as solvents, detergents

and heavy metals. Because the amount of active enzyme can
decline considerably during reaction, in many applications the
kinetics of enzyme deactivation are just as important as the
kinetics of the reaction itself.
In the simplest model of enzyme deactivation, active
enzyme E a undergoes irreversible transformation to an inac-
tive form Ei:
Ea --) E i .
(11.40)
Rate of deactivation is generally considered to be first order in
active enzyme concentration:
ra= ka ea
(11.41)
where rd is the volumetric rate of deactivation, ea is the active
enzyme concentration and kd is the deactivation rate constant.
In a closed system where enzyme deactivation is the only
process affecting the concentration of active enzyme:
-de a

-rd=kdea.
(11.42)
by substituting into Eq. (11.33) the expression for ea from Eq.
(11.43):
Vma~
_
k2eaoe -ht = VmaxOe-kdt
(11.44)
where Vmax0 is the initial value of Vmax before deactivation
occurs.
Stability of enzymes is frequently reported in terms of half-
life. Half-life is the time required for half the enzyme activity to
be lost as a result of deactivation; after one half-life, the active
enzyme concentration equals e*0/2.Substituting ea = ~,0/2 into
Eq. (11.43), taking logarithms and rearranging yields the fol-
lowing expression:
In 2
th-- kd
(11.45)
where th is the enzyme half-life.
Rate of enzyme deactivation is strongly dependent on tem-
perature. This dependency is generally well described using
the Arrhenius equation:
k d = Ae -Ed!RT
(11.46)
Integration of Eq. (11.42) gives an expression for active
enzyme concentration as a function of time:
ea = ea0 e -kdt
(11.43)
where ea0 is the concentration of active enzyme at time zero.
According to Eq. (11.43), concentration of active enzyme
decreases exponentially with time; the greatest rate of enzyme
deactivation occurs when ea is high.
As indicated in Eq. (11.33), the value of ZYma
x for enzyme
reaction depends on the amount of active enzyme present.
Therefore, as ea declines due to deactivation, Vmax is also
diminished. We can estimate the variation of Vmax with time
where A is the Arrhenius constant or frequency factor, Ed is the
activation energy for enzyme deactivation, R is the ideal gas
constant, and T is absolute temperature. According to Eq.
(11.46), as T increases, rate of enzyme deactivation increases
exponentially. Values of Ed are high, of the order
170-400 kJ gmo1-1 for many enzymes [5]. Accordingly, a
temperature rise of 10~ between 30~ and 40~ will increase
the rate of enzyme deactivation by a factor between 10 and
150. The stimulatory effect of increasing temperature on rate
of enzyme reaction has already been described in Section
11.3.4. However, as shown here, raising the temperature also
reduces the amount of active enzyme present. It is clear that
temperature has a critical effect on enzyme kinetics.274

What is the half-life for each form of enzyme?
Solution:
From Eq. (11.31), at any fixed substrate concentration, the rate of enzyme reaction v is directly proportional to Vmax. Therefore,
kd can be determined from Eq. (11.44) using enzyme activity v instead of Vmax. Taking natural logarithms gives:
In v= In v0 - kd t
where v0 is the initial enzyme activity before deactivation. So, if deactivation follows a first-order model, a semi-log plot of reac-
tion rate versus time should give a straight line with slope - ka. The data are plotted in Figure 11E5.1.

11.6 Yields in Cell CultureTable 11.4 Some metabolic yield coefficients
The basic concept of reaction yield was introduced in Section
11.1.2 for simple one-step reactions. When we consider
processes such as cell growth, we are in effect lumping together
many individual enzyme and chemical conversions. Despite
this complexity, yield principles can be applied to cell metab-
olism to relate flow of substrate in metabolic pathways to
formation ofbiomass and other products. Yields which are fie-
quently reported and of particular importance are expressed
using yield coefficientsor yieldfactors. Several yield coefficients,
such as yield ofbiomass from substrate, yield ofbiomass from
oxygen, and yield of product from substrate, are in common
use. Yield coefficients allow us to quantify the nutrient
requirements and production characteristics of an organism.
Some metabolic yield coefficients: the biomass yield Yxs,
the product yield Yvs, and the respiratory quotient RQ, were
introduced in Chapter 4. Definition of yield coefficients can
be generalised as follows:Symbol

where YFG is the yield factor, F and G are substances involved
in metabolism, AFis the mass or moles ofF produced, and A G
is the mass or moles of G consumed. The negative sign is
required in Eq. (11.47) because A G for a consumed substance
is negative in value; yield is calculated as a positive quantity. A
list of frequently-used yield coefficients is given in Table 11.4.
Note that in some cases, such as YPX, both substances repre-
sented by the yield coefficient are products of metabolism.
Although the term 'yield' usually refers to the amount of prod-
uct formed per amount of reactant, yields can also be used
to relate other quantities. Some yield coefficients are based
on quantities such as ATP formed or heat evolved during
metabolism.
1 1.6.1
Overall and Instantaneous
Yields
A problem with application of Eq. (11.47) is that values of AF
and A G depend on the time period over which they are mea-
sured. In batch culture, AF and A G can be calculated as the
difference between initial and final values; this gives an overall
yieldrepresenting some sort of average value for the entire cul-
ture period. Alternatively, AF and A G can be determined
between two other points in time; this calculation might pro-
duce a different value of ~G" Yields can vary during culture,
and it is sometimes necessary to evaluate the instantaneousyield
at a particular point in time. For a closed, constant-volume
reactor in which the reaction between F and G is the onlyII

reaction involving these components, if rl~ and rG are volu-
metric rates of production and consumption of F and G,
respectively, instantaneous yield can be calculated as follows:

When yields for fermentation are reported, the time or time

11.6.2 Theoretical and Observed Yields
As described in Section 11.1.2, it is necessary to distinguish
between theoretical and observed yields. This is particularly
important for cell metabolism because there are always many
reactions occurring at the same time; theoretical and observed
yields are therefore very likely to differ. Consider the example
of biomass yield from substrate, Yxs" If the total mass of sub-
strate consumed is ST, some proportion of ST equal to SG will
be used for growth while the remainder, SR, is channelled into
other products and metabolic activities not related to growth.
Therefore, the observed biomass yield based on total substrate
consumption is:
-AX
YXS D ~

(11.50)
(11.51)
as ASG is the mass of substrate actually directed into biomass
production. Because of the complexity of metabolism, ASG is
usually unknown and the observed yield is the only yield avail-
able. Theoretical yields are sometimes referred to as maximum
possibleyields because they represent the yield in the absence of
competing reactions.

The kinetics of cell growth are expressed using equations simi-
lar to those presented in Section 11.3. From a mathematical
point of view there is little difference between the kinetic equa-
tions for enzymes and cells; after all, cell metabolism depends
on the integrated action of a multitude of enzymes.

11.7.1 Batch Growth
Several phases of cell growth are observed in batch culture; a
typical growth curve is shown in Figure 11.10. The different
phases of growth are more readily distinguished when the nat-
ural logarithm of viable cell concentration is plotted against
time; alternatively, a semi-log plot can be used. Rate of growth
varies depending on the growth phase. During the lag phase
immediately after inoculation, rate of growth is essentially
zero. Cells use the lag phase to adapt to their new environ-
ment; new enzymes or structural components may be
synthesised. Following the lag period, growth starts in the
acceleration phase and continues through the growth and
decline phases. If growth is exponential, the growth phase
appears as a straight line on a semi-log plot. As nutrients in the
culture medium become depleted or inhibitory products accu-
mulate, growth slows down and the cells enter the decline
phase. After this transition period, the stationary phase is
reached during which no further growth occurs. Some cul-
tures exhibit a death phase as the cells lose viability or are
destroyed by lysis. Table 11.6 provides a summary of growth
and metabolic activity during the phases of batch culture.
During the growth and decline phases, rate of cell growth is
described by the equation:
rx=~X
(11.52)
where rX is the volumetric rate of biomass production with
units of, for example, kg m -3 s-I, x is viable cell concentration

with units of, for example, kg m-3, and/u is the specific growth
rate. Specific growth rate has dimensions T - 1. Eq. (11.52) has
the same form as (11.27); cell growth is therefore considered a
first-order autqcatalytic reaction. In a closed system where
growth is the only process affecting cell concentration, rX =
dX/dt and integration of Eq. (11.52) gives an expression for xas
a function of time. If/~ is constant we can integrate directly
with initial condition x - x0 at t - 0 to give:
x= x 0 e~t
(11.53)
where x0 is the viable cell concentration at time zero. Eq.
(11.53) represents exponential growth. Taking natural log-
arithms:
In x = In x o + / ~ t .
(11.54)
According to Eq. (11.54), a plot of In x versus time gives a
straight line with slope/~. Because the relationship of Eq.
(11.54) is strictly valid only if/~ is unchanging, a plot of In x
versus t is often used to assess whether the specific growth rate
is constant. As shown in Figure 11.10, ju is usually constant
during the growth phase. It is always advisable to prepare a
semi-log plot of cell concentration before identifying phases of
growth. As shown in Figure 3.6, if cell concentrations are plot-
ted on linear coordinates, growth often appears slow at .the
beginning of the culture. We might be tempted to conclude
there was a lag phase of 1-2 hours for the culture represented
in Figure 3.6(a). However, when the same data are plotted
using logarithms as shown in Figure 3.6(b), it is clear that the
culture did not experience a lag phase. Growth always appears
much slower at the beginning of culture because the number
of cells present is small.
Cell growth rates are often expressed in terms of the
doubling time td. An expression for doubling time can be
derived from Eq. (11.53). Starting with a cell concentration of
x0, the concentration at t - td is 2x0. Substituting these values
into Eq. (11.53):
2x0 = x o e/'td
(11.55)
and cancelling x0 gives:

11.7.2 Balanced Growth
In an environment favourable for growth, cells regulate their
metabolism and adjust the rates of various internal reactions so
that a condition of balanced growth occurs. During balanced
growth, composition of the biomass remains constant.
Balanced growth means that the cell is able to modulate the
effect of external conditions and keep the cell composition
steady despite changes in environmental conditions.
For biomass composition to remain constant during
growth, the specific rate of production of each component in
the culture must be equal to the cell specific growth-rate/r
rz = /~z
(11.59)
where Z is a cellular constituent such as protein, RNA, poly-
saccharide, etc., rz is the volumetric rate of production of Z,
and z is the concentration of Z in the reactor volume.
Therefore, during balanced growth the doubling time for each
cell component must be equal to td for growth. Balanced
growth cannot be achieved if environmental changes affect
rate of growth. In most cultures, balanced growth occurs at the
same time as exponential growth.
11.7.3 Effect of Substrate Concentration
During the growth and decline phases of batch culture, the
specific growth rate of cells is dependent on the concentration
of nutrients in the medium. Often, a single substrate exerts a
dominant influence on rate of growth; this component is
known as the growth-rate-limiting substrate or, more simply,
the growth-limiting substrate. The growth-limiting substrate is
often the carbon or nitrogen source, although in some cases it
is oxygen or another oxidant such as nitrate. During balanced
growth, the specific growth rate is related to the concentration
of growth-limiting substrate by the Monod equation, a homo-
logue of the Michaelis-Menten expression:
2 = e*q.

parameters of the cell-substrate system; values of Ks for several
organisms are listed in Table 11.7.
Typical values of Ks are very small, of the order of mg per
litre for carbohydrate substrates and lag per litre for other com-
pounds such as amino acids. The level of growth-limiting
substrate in culture media is normally much greater than Ks.
As a result, growth can be approximated using zero-order
kinetics with growth rate independent of substrate concentra-
tion until s reaches very low values. By analogy with
Michaelis-Menten kinetics described in Section 11.3.3,
/a ~ jUmax provided s is greater than about 10 Ks. Because Ks is
usually very small compared with the starting substrate
concentration, s remains > 10 Ks during most of the culture
period. This explains why/~ remains constant and equal to
/~maxin batch culture until the medium is virtually exhausted
of substrate. When s finally falls below 10 Ks, transition from
growth to stationary phase can be very abrupt as the low level
of residual substrate is rapidly consumed by the large number
of cells present.
The Monod equation is by far the most frequently-used
expression relating growth rate to substrate concentration.
However, it is valid only for balanced growth and should not
be applied when growth conditions are changing rapidly.

There are also other restrictions; for example, the Monod
equation has been found to have limited applicability at
extremely low substrate levels. ~grhen growth is inhibited by
high substrate or product concentrations, extra terms can be
added~ to the Monod equation to account for these effects.
Several other kinetic expressions have been developed for cell
growth; these provide better correlations with experimental
data in certain situations [8-11].
11.8 Growth Kinetics With Plasmid
Instability
A potential problem in culture of recombinant organisms is
plasmid loss or inactivation. Plasmid instability occurs in indi-
vidual cells which, by reproducing, can generate a large
plasmid-free population in the reactor and reducethe overall
rate of synthesis ofplasmid-encoded products. Plasmid instab-
ility occurs as a result of DNA mutation or defective plasmid
segregation. For segregational stability, the total number of
plasmids present in the culture must double once per genera-
tion, and the plasmid copies must be equally distributed
between mother and daughter cells.II Homogeneous
Reactions
280
A simple model has been developed for batch culture to
describe changes in the fraction of plasmid-bearing cells as a
function of time [12]. The important parameters in this model
are the probability of plasmid loss per generation of cells, and
the difference in the growth rates ofplasmid-bearing and plas-
mid-free cells. Exponential growth of the host cells is assumed.
If x § is the concentration of plasmid-carrying cells and x - is
the concentration of plasmid-free cells, the rates at which the
two cell populations grow are:
taneously with initial condition x + - x~ and x - - x o at t - 0.

is the probability of plasmid loss per cell division (p <~ 1),/,§ is
the specific growth rate ofplasmid-carrying cells, and/~- is the
specific growth rate of plasmid-free cells. The model assumes
that all plasmid-containing cells are identical in growth rate
and probability of plasmid loss; this is the same as assuming
that all plasmid-containing cells have the same copy number.
By comparing Eq. (11.61) with Eq. (11.52) we can see that the
rate of growth of the plasmid-bearing population is reduced by
p ~§ x § This is because some of the progeny of plasmid-bear-
ing cells do not contain plasmid and do not join the
plasmid-bearing population. On the other hand, growth of
the plasmid-free population has two contributions as indicat-
ed in Eq. (11.62). Existing plasmid-free cells grow with
specific growth rate/u- as usual; in addition, this population is
supplemented by generation ofplasmid-free cells due to defec-
tive plasmid segregation by plasmid-carrying cells.
At any time, the fraction of cells in the culture with plasmid
is:

The value of Fdepends on a, the ratio of the specific growth
rates of plasmid-free and plasmid-carrying cells. In the
absence of selection pressure, presence of plasmid usually
reduces the growth rate of organisms due to the additional
metabolic requirements imposed by the plasmid DNA.
Therefore a is usually > 1. In general, the difference between
/~+ and/~- becomes more pronounced as the size of the

plasmid or copy number increases. Some values of a from the
literature are listed in Table 11.8; typically 1.0 < a < 2.0.
Under selection pressure a may equal zero; if the plasmid
encodes biosynthetic enzymes for essential nutrients, loss of
plasmid may result in M-= 0. When this is the case, Fremains
close to 1 as the plasmid-free population cannot reproduce.
F also depends on p, the probability of plasmid loss
per generation, which can be as high as 0.1 if segregation
occurs. When mutation or random insertions or deletions are
the only cause of plasmid instability, p is usually much lower
at about 10-6. Plasmid fragmentation within a host cell can
occur with higher frequency if the cloning vector is inherently
unstable.
Batch culture of microorganisms usually requires 25 cell
generations or more. Results for F after 25 generations have
been calculated from Eq. (11.64) and are shown in Figure
11.12 as function ofp and a. F deteriorates substantially as a
increases from 1.0 to 2.0. Cultures with p < 0.01 and a < I are
relatively stable, with Fafter 25 generations remaining close to
1. Further application of Eq. (11.64) is illustrated in Example
11.7.

A plasmid-containing strain of E. coli is used to produce recombinant protein in a 250-1itre fermenter. The probability of plas-
mid loss per generation is 0.005. The specific growth rate of plasmid-free cells is 1.4 h - l ; the specific growth-rate of
plasmid-bearing cells is 1.2 h -1. Estimate the fraction of plasmid-bearing cells after 18 h growth if the inoculum contains only
cells with plasmid.
Solution:
The number of generations of plasmid-carrying cells in 18 h is calculated from Eq. (11.66)"
n=
(1.2 h -1) 18 h

Substituting this into Eq. (11.64) with p -- 0.005 and a = 1.4 h - l ]1.2 h -1 = 1.17:
F=
1 - 1.17 - 0.005
= 0.45.
1 - 1.17 - 231(117 + 0.005- 1)0.00 5
Therefore, after 18 h only 45% of the cells contain plasmid.
Alternative models for growth with plasmid instability have
been developed [13]; some include equations for substrate
utilisation and product formation [ 14]. A weakness in the sim-
ple model presented here is the assumption that all
plasmid-containing cells are the same. In reality there are dif-
ferences in copy number and therefore specific growth rate
between plasmid-carrying cells; probability of plasmid loss
also varies from cell to cell. More complex models that recog-
nise the segregated nature ofplasmid populations are available
[15, 16].I I Homogeneous Reactions

11.9 Production Kinetics in Cell Culture
In this section we consider the kinetics of production of low-
molecular-weight compounds, such as ethanol, amino acids,
antibiotics and vitamins, which are excreted from cells in
culture. As shown in Table 11.9, fermentation products can be
classified according to the relationship between product
synthesis and energy generation in the cell [10, 17].
Compounds in the first category are formed directly as end- or
by-products of energy metabolism; these materials are synthe-
sised in pathways which produce ATP. The second class of
product is partly linked to energy generation but requires
additional energy for synthesis. Formation of other products
such as antibiotics involves reactions far removed from energy
metabolism.

11.9.1 Product Formation Directly Coupled
With Energy Metabolism
For products formed in pathways which generate ATP, rate of
production is related to cellular energy demand. Growth is
usually the major energy-requiring function of cells; therefore,
if production is coupled to energy metabolism, product will be
formed whenever there is growth. However, ATP is also
required for other activities called maintenance. Examples of
maintenance functions include cell motility, turnover of cellu-
lar components and adjustment of membrane potential and
internal pH. Maintenance activities are carried out by living
cells even in the absence of growth. Products synthesised in
energy pathways will be produced whenever maintenance
functions are carried out because ATP is required. Kinetic
expressions for product formation must account for growth-
associated and maintenance-associated production, as in the
following equation:
rp = YPX rx+ mpX.
Products indirectly associated Amino acids and their
with energy generation
products, citric acid,
nucleotides
Products for which there is
Penicillin, streptomycin,
vitamins
no clear direct or indirect
coupling to energy generation
(11.68)
In Eq. (11.68), rX is the volumetric rate ofbiomass formation,
YPx is the theoretical or true yield of product from biomass, mp
is the specificrateofproductformation due to maintenance, and x
is biomass concentration, mp has dimensions T -1 and typical
units kg product (kg biomass) -1 s-1. Eq. (11.68) states that
rate of product formation depends partly on rate of growth but
also partly on cell concentration. From Eq. (11.52), rX is equal
to/u x; therefore:
rp = ( YPX/~+ mp)x.
(11.69)
Irrespective of the class of product, rate of product forma-
tion in cell culture can be expressed as a function of biomass
concentration:
Comparison of Eqs (11.67) and (11.69) shows that, for prod-
ucts coupled to energy metabolism, qp is equal to a combination
of growth-associated and non-growth-associated terms:
rp = qp x
(11.67)
qp = Y v x ~ + mv.
(11.70)
where rp is the volumetric rate of product formation with
units of, for example, kg m -3 s-1, x is biomass concentration,
and qp is the specificrate ofproductformation with dimensions
T -1. qp can be evaluated at any time during fermentation as
the ratio of production rate and biomass concentration; qp is
not necessarily constant during batch culture. Depending on
whether the product is linked to energy metabolism or not, we
can develop equations for qp as a function of growth rate and
other metabolic parameters.
11.9.2 Product Formation Indirectly Coupled
With Energy Metabolism
When product is synthesised partly in metabolic pathways
used for energy generation and partly in other pathways
requiring energy, the relationship between product formation
and growth can be complicated. We will not attempt to
develop equations for qv for this type of product. A generalisedIZ HomogeneousReactions
1,83.
i
treatment of indirectly-coupled product formation is given by
Roels and Kossen [ 10].
11.9.3 Product Formation Not Coupled With
Energy Metabolism
Production not involving energy metabolism is difficult to
relate to growth because growth and product synthesis are
somewhat dissociated. However in some cases, rate of forma-
tion of non-growth-associated product is directly proportional
to biomass concentration, so that production rate as defined in
Eq. (11.67) can be applied with constant qp. Sometimes qp is a
complex function of growth rate and must be expressed using
empirical equations derived from experiment. An example is
penicillin synthesis; equations for rate of penicillin production
as a function of biomass concentration and specific growth
rate have been derived by Heijnen et al. [ 18].
11.10 Kinetics of Substrate Uptake in Cell
Culture
Cells consume substrate from the external environment and
channel it into different metabolic pathways. Some substrate
may be directed into growth and product synthesis; another
fraction is used to generate energy for maintenance activities.
Substrate requirements for maintenance vary considerably
depending on the organism and culture conditions; a
complete account of substrate uptake should include a
maintenance component. The specific rate ofsubstrate uptake
for maintenance activities is known as the maintenance
coefficient, ms. The dimensions of ms are T - 1; typical units are

nance coefficients for various microorganisms are listed in
Table 11.10. Ionic strength greatly influences the value of ms;
significant amounts of energy are needed to maintain concen-
tration gradients across cell membranes. The physiological
significance of ms has been the subject of much debate; there
are indications that ms for a particular organism may not be
constant at all possible growth rates.
Rate of substrate uptake can be expressed as a function of
biomass concentration by an equation analogous to Eq. (11.67):
rs= qs x
(11.71)
where rs is the volumetric rate of substrate consumption with
units of, for example, kg m -3 s-1, qs is the specific rate ofsub-
strate uptake, and x is biomass concentration. Like qp, qs has
dimensions T - 1. In this section, we will develop equations for
qs as a function of growth rate and other relevant metabolic
parameters.
11.10.1 Substrate Uptake in the Absence of
Product Formation
In some cultures there is no extracellular product formation;
for example, biomass itself is the product in manufacture of
bakers' yeast and single-ceU protein. In the absence of product
formation, we assume that all substrate entering the cell is used
for growth and maintenance functions. Rates of these cell
activities are related as follows:

In Eq. (11.72), rX is the volumetric rate of biomass produc-
tion, Yxs is the true yield of biomass from substrate, ms is the
maintenance coefficient, and x is biomass concentration. Eq.
(11.72) states that rate of substrate uptake depends partly on
the rate of growth but also varies with cell concentration.
When rX is expressed using Eq. (11.52), Eq. (11.72) becomes:
rs=-

using Eq. (11.60), Eq. (11.73) becomes:
--[ ~UmaxS + mS]x.
rs =
Yxs(Ks+s )
(11.74)
When s is zero, Eq. (11.74) predicts that substrate consump-
tion will proceed at a rate equal to ms x. Substrate uptake in the
absence ofsubstrate is impossible; this feature of Eq. (11.74) is
therefore unrealistic. The problem arises because of implicit
assumptions we have made about the nature of maintenance
activities. It can be shown however that Eq. (11.74) is a realis-
tic description of substrate uptake as long as there is external
substrate available; when the substrate is exhausted mainte-
nance energy is generally supplied by endogenous metabolism.
11.10.2 Substrate Uptake With Product
Formation
Patterns of substrate flow in cells synthesising products
depend on whether product formation is coupled to energy
metabolism. When products are formed in energy-generating
pathways, e.g. in anaerobic culture, product synthesis is an
unavoidable consequence of cell growth and maintenance.
Accordingly, as illustrated in Figure 11.13(a), there is no sepa-
rate flow of substrate into the cell for product synthesis;
product is formed from the substrate taken up to support
growth and maintenance. Substrate consumed for mainte-
nance does not contribute to growth; it therefore constitutes a
separate substrate flow into the cell. In contrast, when produc-
tion is not linked or only partly linked to energy metabolism,
all or some of the substrate required for product synthesis is
additional to, and separate from, that needed for growth and
maintenance. Flow of substrate in this case is illustrated in
Figure 11.13(b).
When products are directly linked to energy generation,
equations for rate of substrate consumption do not include a
separate term for production; substrate requirements for prod-
uct formation are already accounted for in terms for growth-
and maintenance-associated substrate uptake. Accordingly,
equations presented in the previous section for substrate con-
sumption in the absence of product formation apply; rate of
substrate uptake is related to growth and maintenance require-
ments by Eqs (11.73) and (11.74).
In cultures where product synthesis is only indirectly
coupled to energy metabolism, rate of substrate consumption
is a function of three factors: growth rate, rate of product for-
mation and rate of substrate uptake for maintenance. These
different cell functions can be related using yield and mainte-
nance coefficients:

11.11 Effect of Culture Conditions on Cell
Kinetics
Temperature has a marked effect on metabolic rate.
Temperature has a direct influence on reaction rate according
to the Arrhenius law; it can also change the configuration of
cell constituents, especially proteins and membrane com-
ponents. In general, the effect of temperature on growth is
similar to that already described in Section 11.3.4 for
enzymes. There is an approximate two fold increase in specif-
ic growth rate for every 10~ rise in temperature, until
structural breakdown of cell proteins and lipids starts to
occur. Like other rate constants, the maintenance coefficient
ms has an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence [19]; this
can have a significant kinetic effect on cultures where
turnover of macromolecules is an important contribution to
maintenance requirements. In contrast, temperature has only
a minor effect on the biomass yield coefficient, Yxs [19].
Other cellular responses to temperature are described else-
where [ 1, 20, 21].
Growth rate depends on medium pH in much the same
way as enzyme activity (Section 11.3.4); maximum growth
rate is usually maintained over 1-2 pH units but declines with
further variation, pH also affects the profile of product synthe-
sis in anaerobic culture and can change maintenance-energy
requirements [ 1, 20, 21].
11.12 Determining Cell Kinetic Parameters
From Batch Data
In order to apply the equations presented in Sections
11.6-11.10 to real fermentations, we must know the kinetic
Determining growth rates in cell culture requires measure-
ment of cell concentration. Many different experimental
procedures are applied for biomass estimation [20, 22]. Direct
measurement can be made of cell number, dry or wet cell mass,
packed cell volume or culture turbidity; alternatively, indirect
estimates are obtained from measurements of product forma-
tion, heat evolution or cell composition. Cell viability is
usually evaluated using plating or staining techniques. Each
method for biomass estimation will give somewhat different
results. For example, rate of growth determined using cell dry
weight may differ from that obtained from cell number
because dry weight in the culture can increase without a corre-
sponding increase cell number.
Irrespective of how cell concentration is measured, the
techniques described in Section 11.2 for graphical differentia-
tion of concentration data are suitable for determining
volumetric growth rates in batch culture. The results will
depend to some extent on how the data are smoothed. For rea-
sons described in Section 11.7.3, there is usually a relatively
abrupt change in growth rate between growth and stationary
phases; this feature requires extra care for accurate differentia-
tion of batch growth curves. As discussed in Section 3.3.1, an
advantage of hand-smoothing is that it allows us to judge the
significance of individual points. Once the volumetric growth
rate rX is known, the specific growth rate/~ is obtained by
dividing rX by the cell concentration.
For the growth phase of batch culture, an alternative
method can be applied to calculate/~. Assuming growth can be
represented by the first-order model of Eq. (11.52), the inte-
grated relationship of Eq. (11.53) or (11.54) allows us to
obtain/a directly. During the growth phase when/~ is essential-
ly constant, a plot of In x versus time gives a straight line with
slope ju. This is illustrated in Example 11.8.II Homogeneous Reactions

Volumetric rates of substrate uptake and product formation,
rs and rp, can be evaluated by graphical differentiation of sub-
strate- and product-concentration data, respectively. Specific
product-formation rate qp and specific substrate-uptake rate
qs are obtained by dividing the respective volumetric rates by
cell concentration.

Effect of Maintenance
on Yields
True yields such as Yxs, YPXand Yes are often difficult to eval-
uate. Although true yields are essentially stoichiometric
coefficients, the stoichiometry of biomass production and
product formation is only known for relatively simple fermen-

11.13.1 Observed Yields
Expressions for observed yield coefficients can be obtained by
applying Eq. (11.48):

The Monod equation for specific growth rate, Eq. (11.60), is
analogous mathematically to the Michaelis-Menten expression
for enzyme kinetics. In principle therefore, the techniques
described in Section 11.4 for determining Vmax and Km for
enzyme reaction can be applied for evaluation of/~max and Ks.
However, because values of K~ in cell culture are usually very
low, accurate determination of this parameter from batch data is
difficult. Better estimation of K~ can be made using continuous
culture of cells as discussed in Chapter 13. On the other hand,
measurement of/Umax from batch data is relatively straightfor-
ward. As described in Section 11.7.3, if all nutrients are present
in excess, the specific growth rate during exponential growth is
equal to the maximum specific growth rate. Therefore, the spe-
cific growth rate calculated in Example 11.8 is equal to/~max"

as the ratio of rates evaluated at that instant. Observed yields are
not necessarily constant throughout batch culture; in some cases
they exhibit significant dependence on environmental parame-
ters such as substrate concentration and growth rate.
Nevertheless, for many cultures, the observed biomass yield
Yxs is approximately constant. Because of the errors in experi-
mental data, considerable uncertainty is usually associated with
measured yield coefficients.When the culture produces compounds not directly
coupled with energy metabolism, Eqs (11.80) and (11.81) do
not apply because a different expression for rs must be used in
Eq. (11.77). Determination of true yields and maintenance
coefficients is more difficult in this case because of the number
of terms involved.
11.13.2 Biomass Yield From SubstrateObserved yield of product from biomass YPXis defined in Eq.
(11.78). When product synthesis is directly coupled to energy
metabolism, rp is given by Eq. (11.69). Substituting this and
Eq. (11.52) into Eq. (11.78) gives:
Equations for true biomass yield can be determined for sys-
tems without extracellular product formation or when
product synthesis is directly coupled to energy metabolism.
Substituting expressions for rX and rs from Eqs (11.52) and
(11.73) into Eq. (11.77) gives:

The extent of deviation of Yp'xfrom Yvx depends on the rela-

decreased. Eq. (11.82) does not apply to products not directly
coupled with energy metabolism; we do not have a general
expression for rp in terms of true yield coefficients for this class
of product.
ju
(11.81)
Therefore, if Yxs and ms are relatively constant, a plot of
l/Y'xs versus 1//, gives a straight line with slope ms and inter-
cept 1/Yxs. Eq. (11.81) is not generally applied to batch
growth data; under typical batch conditions, ~ does not vary
from/~max for much of the culture period so it is difficult to
plot Y ~ as a function of specific growth rate. We will revisit
Eq. (11.81) when we consider continuous cell culture in
Chapter 13. As a rule of thumb, true biomass yield from glu-
cose under aerobic conditions is around 0.5 g g- 1.
In processes such as production of bakers' yeast and single-
cell protein where the required product is biomass, it is desirable
to maximise the actual or observed yield of cells from substrate.
The true yield Yxs is limited by stoichiometric considerations.
However, from Eq. (11.80), Y ~ can be improved by decreas-
ing the maintenance coefficient or increasing the growth rate.
ms may be reduced by lowering the temperature of fermenta-
tion, using a medium of lower ionic strength, or by applying a
different organism or strain with lower maintenance-energy
requirements. Assuming these changes do not reduce the
growth rate, they can be employed to improve the biomass yield.

In many anaerobic fermentations such as ethanol production,
yield of product from substrate is a critical factor affecting
process economics. At high Y~'s'more ethanol is produced per
mass of carbohydrate consumed so that the cost of production is
reduced. Growth rate has a strong effect on YP'Sfor ethanol.
Because YP'Sis low when/~ =/~max' it is desirable to reduce the
specific growth rate of the cells. Low growth rate can be
obtained by depriving the cells of some essential nutrient, e.g. a
nitrogen source, or by immobilising the cells to prevent growth.
Increasing the rate of maintenance activity relative to growthz89

will also enhance product yield. This can be done by using a
medium of high ionic strength, raising the temperature, or
selecting a mutant or different organism with high maintenance
requirements. Continuous culture provides more opportunity
for manipulating rates of growth than batch culture.
The effect of growth rate and maintenance on YPS is diffi-
cult to determine for products not directly coupled with
energy metabolism unless information is available about the
effect of these parameters on qp.
11.14 Kinetics of Cell Death
The kinetics of cell death is an important consideration in
design of sterilisation processes and in analysis of fermenta-
tions where substantial viability loss is expected. In a lethal
environment, cells in a population do not die all at once; de-
activation of the culture occurs over a finite period of time
depending on the initial number of viable cells and the severity
of the conditions imposed. Loss. of cell viability can be
described mathematically in much the same way as enzyme
deactivation; cell death is assumed to be a first-order process:
rd= kd N
N = N Oe-kat
(11.87)
where N Ois the number of viable cells at time zero. Taking nat-
ural logarithms of both sides of Eq. (11-87) gives:
I n N = In N 0 - kd t.
(11.88)
According to Eq. (11.88), if first-order death kinetics apply, a
plot of In N versus t gives a straight line with slope - k d.
Experimental measurements for many vegetative cells have
confirmed the relationship of Eq. (11.88); as an example, data
for thermal death ofEscherichia coliat various temperatures are
shown in Figure 11.15. However, first-order death kinetics do
not always hold, particularly for bacterial spores immediately
after exposure to heat.
Like other kinetic constants, the value of the specific death
constant kd depends on temperature. This effect can be
described using the Arrhenius relationship of Eq. (11.46).
Typical Ed values for thermal destruction of microorganisms
are high, of the order 250-290 kJ gmo1-1 [23]. Therefore,
small increases in temperature have a significant effect on kd
and rate of death.
(11.84)
where rd is rate of cell death, Nis number ofviable cells, and kd
is the specific death constant. Alternatively, rate of cell death can
be expressed using cell concentration rather than cell number:

thermal death for vegetative Escherichia coli cells. (From S.
Aiba, A.E. Humphrey and N.F. Millis, 1965, Biochemical
Engineering, Academic Press, New York.)

rd= kdx
(11.85)
where kd is the specific death constant based on cell concentra-
tion and x is the concentration of viable cells.

viable cell concentration, rate of cell death is equal to the rate
of decrease in cell number. Therefore, from Eq. (11.84):

As contaminating organisms are being killed by heat sterilisa-
tion, nutrients in the medium may also be destroyed. The
sensitivity of nutrient molecules to temperature is described by
the Arrhenius equation of Eq. (11.46). Values of the activation
energy Ed for thermal destruction of vitamins and amino acids
are 84-92 kJ gmol-1; for proteins Ed is about 165 kJ gmo1-1
[23]. Because these values are somewhat lower than typical Ed
values for microorganisms, raising the temperature has a
greater effect on cell death than nutrient destruction. This
means that sterilisation at higher temperatures for shorter
periods of time has the advantage of killing cells with limited
destruction of medium components.

Heterogeneous Reactions
In theprevious chapter, reaction rate was considered as a function of substrate concentration and temperature. Reaction
systems were assumed to be homogeneous; local variations in concentration and rate of conversion were not examined. Yet, in
many bioprocesses, concentrations of substrates andproducts differj~om point to point in the reaction mixture. Concentration
gradients arise in single-phase systems when mixing is poor; i f differentphases arepresent, local variations in composition can
be considerable. As described in Chapter 9, concentration gradients occur within phase boundary layers around gas bubbles
and solids. More severe gradients are found inside solid biocatalysts such as cellflocs, pellets, biofilms, and immobilised-cell
and-enzyme beads.
Reactions occurring in the presence of significant concentra-
tion or temperature gradients are called heterogeneous reactions.
Because biological reactions are not generally associated with
large temperature gradients, we confine our attention in this
chapter to concentration effects. When heterogeneous reac-
tions occur in solid catalysts, not all reactive molecules are
available for immediate conversion. Reaction takes place only
after reactants are transported to the site of reaction. Thus,
mass-transfer processes can have a considerable influence on
the overall conversion rate.
Because rate of reaction is generally dependent on substrate
concentration, when concentrations in the system vary, kin-
etic analysis becomes more complex. The principles of homo-
geneous reaction and the equations outlined in Chapter 11
remain valid for heterogeneous systems; however, the concen-
trations used in these equations must be those actually
prevailing at the site of reaction. For solid biocatalysts, we
must know the concentration of substrate at each point inside
the solid in order to determine the local rate of conversion. In
most cases these concentrations cannot be measured; fortu-
nately, they can be estimated using diffusion-reaction theory.
In this chapter, methods are presented for analysing reac-
tions affected by mass transfer. The mathematics required is
more sophisticated than is applied elsewhere in this book;
however, attention can be directed to the results of the analysis
rather than to the mathematical derivations. The practical out-
come of this chapter is simple criteria for assessing
mass-transfer limitations which can be used directly in experi-
mental design.
12.1 Heterogeneous Reactions in
Bioprocessing
Reactions involving solid-phase catalysts are important in
bioprocessing. Macroscopic flocs, clumps and pellets are
produced naturally by certain bacteria and fungi; mycelial pel-
lets are common in antibiotic fermentations. Some cells grow as
biofilms on reactor walls; others form slimes such as in
waste treatment processes. Plant cell suspensions invariably con-
tain aggregates; microorganisms in soil crumbs play a crucial
role in environmental bioremediation of land. Animal tissues
are now being cultured on three-dimensional scaffolds for surgi-
cal transplantation and organ repair. More traditionally, many
food fermentations involve microorganisms attached to solid
particles. In all of these systems, rate of reaction depends on the
rate of mass transfer outside or within the solid catalyst.
If cells or enzymes do not spontaneously form clumps or
attach to solid surfaces, they can be induced to do so using
immobilisation techniques. Many procedures are available for
artificial immobilisation of cells and enzymes; the results of
two commonly-used methods are illustrated in Figure 12.1. As
shown in Figure 12. l(a), cells and enzymes can be immobil-
ised by entrapment within gels such as alginate, agarose and
carrageenan. Cells or enzymes are mixed with liquified gel
before it is hardened or cross-linked and broken into small par-
ticles. The gel polymer must be porous and relatively soft to
allow diffusion of reactants and products to and from the
interior of the particle. As shown in Figure 12.1 (b), an alterna-
tive to gel immobilisation is entrapment within porous solidsI2 Heterogeneous

12.2 C o n c e n t r a t i o n Gradients and Reaction
Rates in Solid Catalysts
Immobilised enzyme
Pores
such as ceramics, porous glass and resin beads. Enzymes or
cells migrate into the pores of these particles and attach to the
internal surfaces; substrate must diffuse through the pores for
reaction to occur. In both immobilisation methods, sites of
reaction are distributed throughout the particle. Thus, a cata-
lyst particle of higher activity can be formed by increasing the
loading of cells or enzyme per volume of matrix.
Immobilised biocatalysts have many advantages in large-
scale processing. One of the most important is continuous
operation using the same catalytic material. For enzymes, an
additional advantage is that immobilisation often enhances
stability and increases the enzyme half-life. Further discussion
of immobilisation methods and the rationale behind cell and
enzyme immobilisation can be found in many articles and
books; a selection of references is given at the end of this
chapter.
In Chapter 11, enzymes and cells were considered as bio-
logical catalysts. In heterogeneous reactions involving a solid
phase, the term 'catalyst' is also used to refer to the entire cata-
lytically-active body, such as a particle or biofilm. Engineering
analysis of heterogeneous reactions applies equally well to
naturally occurring solid catalysts and artificially immobilised
cells and enzymes.
Consider a spherical catalyst of radius R immersed in well-
mixed liquid containing substrate A. In the bulk liquid away
from the particle the substrate concentration is uniform and
equal to CAB. If the particle were inactive, after some time the
concentration of substrate inside the solid would reach a con-
stant value in equilibrium with CAB. However, when substrate
is consumed by reaction, its concentration CA decreases
within the particle as shown in Figure 12.2. If immobilised
cells or enzymes are distributed uniformly within the catalyst,
the concentration profile is symmetrical with a minimum at
the centre. Mass transfer of substrate to reaction sites in the
particle is driven by the concentration difference between the
bulk solution and particle interior.
In the bulk liquid, substrate is carried rapidly by convective
currents. However, as substrate molecules approach the solid
they must be transported from the bulk liquid across the rela-
tively stagnant boundary layer to the solid surface; this process
is called external mass transfer. A concentration gradient devel-
ops across the boundary layer from CAB in the bulk liquid to
CA~ at the solid-liquid interface. If the particle were not por-
ous and all enzyme or cells confined to its outer surface,
external mass transfer would be the only transport process
required. More often, reaction takes place inside the particle so
that internal mass transferthrough the solid is also required.
Although the form of the concentration gradient shown in
Figure 12.2 is typical, other variations are possible. If mass trans-
fer is much slower than reaction, it is possible that all substrate
entering the particle will be consumed before reaching theI 2 Heterogeneous Reactions

continuity of concentration at the solid-liquid interface shows
that substrate distributes preferentially to the solid phase.
Conversely, Figure 12.3(c) shows the concentrations when
substrate is attracted more to the liquid than to the solid.
The effect of mass transfer on intraparticle concentration can
be magnified or diminished by substrate partitioning.
Partitioning is important when the substrate and solid are
charged or if strong hydrophobic interactions cause repulsion
or attraction. Because most materials used for cell and enzyme
immobilisation are very porous and contain a high percentage of
water, partition effects can often be neglected. In our treatment
of heterogeneous reaction, we will assume that partitioning is
not significant.

centre. In this case, the concentration falls to zero within the
solid as illustrated in Figure 12.3(a). Cells or enzyme near the
centre are starved of substrate and the core of the particle
becomes inactive. In the examples of Figures 12.3(b) and
12.3(c), the partition coefficient for the substrate is not equal to
unity. This means that, at equilibrium and in the absence of
reaction, the concentration of substrate in the solid is naturally
higher or lower than in the liquid. In Figure 12.3(b), the dis-
True and Observed
Reaction
Rates
Because concentrations vary in solid catalysts, local rates of
reaction also vary depending on position within the particle.
Even for zero-order reactions, reaction rate changes with posi-
tion if substrate is exhausted. Each cell or enzyme molecule
responds to the substrate concentration at its location with a
rate of reaction determined by the kinetic parameters of the
catalyst. This local rate of reaction is known as the true rate or
intrinsic rate. Like any reaction rate, intrinsic rates can be
expressed using total, volumetric or specific bases as described
in Section 11.1.3. The relationship between true reaction rate
and local substrate concentration follows the principles out-
lined in Chapter 11 for homogeneous reactions.
True local reaction rates are difficult to measure in solid
catalysts without altering the reaction conditions. It is poss-
ible, however, to measure the overall reaction rate for the
entire catalyst. In a closed system, the rate of disappearance of
substrate from the bulk liquid must equal the overall rate of
conversion by reaction; in heterogeneous systems this is also
called the observed rate. It is important to remember that the
observed rate is not usually equal to the true activity of any cell
or enzyme in the particle. Because intraparticle substrate levels
are reduced inside solid catalysts, we expect the observed rate
to be less than if the entire particle were exposed to the bulk
liquid. The relationship between observed rate and bulk sub-
strate concentration is not as simple as in homogeneous
reactions. Kinetic equations for heterogeneous reactions also
involve mass-transfer parameters.
True reaction rates depend on the kinetic parameters of the
cells or enzyme. For example, rate of reaction by an immobilised

can be altered during immobilisation as a result ofcell or enzyme
damage, configurational change and steric hindrance, values
measured before immobilisation may not apply. Unfortunately,
true kinetic parameters for immobilised biocatalysts can be diffi-
cult to determine became measured reaction rates incorporate
mass transfer effects. The problem of evaluating true kinetic
parameters is discussed further in Section 12.9.

and
Rates of reaction and substrate mass transfer are not indepen-
dent in heterogeneous systems. Rate of mass transfer depends
on the concentration gradient established in the system; this in
turn depends on the rate of substrate depletion by reaction.
On the other hand, rate of reaction depends on the availability
ofsubstrate; this of course depends on the rate of mass transfer.
One of the objectives in analysing heterogeneous reactions is
to determine the relative influences of mass transfer and reac-
tion on observed reaction rates. One can conceive, for
example, that ifa reaction proceeds slowly even in the presence
of adequate substrate, it is likely that mass transfer will be rapid
enough to meet the reaction demand. In this case, the
observed rate would be determined more directly by the reac-
tion process than mass transfer. Conversely, if the reaction
tends to be very rapid, it is likely that mass transfer will be
too slow to supply substrate at the rate required. The observed
rate would then reflect strongly the rate of mass transfer. As
will be shown in the remainder of this chapter, there are math-
ematical criteria for assessing the extent to which mass transfer
influences the observed reaction rate. Reactions which are
significantly affected are called mass-transfer limited or
diffusion-limitedreactions. It is also possible to distinguish the
relative influence of internal and external mass transfer.
Improvement of mass transfer and the elimination of mass-
transfer limitations are desired objectives in heterogeneous
catalysis. Once the effect and location of major mass-transfer
resistances are identified, it is then possible to devise strategies
for their elimination.
12.3 Internal Mass Transfer and Reaction
Let us now concentrate on the processes occurring within a
solid biocatalyst; external mass transfer will be examined later
in the chapter. The exact equations and procedures used in
this analysis depend on the geometry of the system and the
reaction kinetics. First, let us consider the case of cells or
enzymes immobilised in a spherical particle.

12.3.1 Steady-State Shell Mass Balance
Mathematical analysis of heterogeneous reactions involves a
technique called the shell mass balance. In this section, we will
perform a shell mass balance on a spherical catalyst particle of
radius R. Imagine a thin spherical shell of thickness Arlocated
at radius rfrom the centre, as shown in Figure 12.4. It may be
helpful to think of this shell as the thin wall of a ping-pong ball
encased inside and concentric with a larger cricket ball of
radius R. Substrate diffusing into the sphere must cross the
shell to reach the centre.
A mass balance of substrate is performed around the shell
by considering the processes of mass transfer and reaction
occurring at radius r. The system considered for the mass bal-
ance is the shell only; the remainder of the sphere is ignored for
the moment. Substrate diffuses into the shell at radius (r+ Ar)
and leaves at radius r; within the shell, immobilised cells or
enzyme consume substrate by reaction. Flow of mass through
the shell can be analysed using the general mass-balance equa-
tion derived in Chapter 4:

Heterogeneous Reactions
Before application of Eq. (4.1), certain assumptions must be
made so that each term in the equation can be expressed math-
ematically [ 1].
The particle is isothermal Kinetic parameters for enzyme
and cell reactions are strong functions of temperature. If
temperature in the particle varies, different values of the
kinetic parameters must be applied. However, as temper-
ature gradients generated by immobilised cells and
enzymes are generally negligible, assuming constant tem-
perature throughout the particle is reasonable and greatly
simplifies the mathematical analysis.
(ii) Mass transfer occurs by diffusion only. We will assume that
the particle is impermeable to,flow, so that convection
within the pores is negligible. This assumption is valid for
many solid-phase biocatalysts. However, some anomalies
have been reported [2, 3]; depending on pore size, pres-
sure gradients can induce convection of liquid through
the particle and significantly enhance nutrient supply.
When convective transport occurs, the analysis of mass
transfer and reaction presented in this chapter must be
modified [4-6].
(iii) Diffusion can be described using Fick's law with constant
s
diffusivity. We will assume that diffusive trans-
port through the particle is governed by Fick's law
(Section 9.1.1). Interaction of substrate with other con-
centration gradients and phenomena affecting transport
of charged species are ignored. Fick's law will be applied
using the ~r
diffusivity of substrate in the solid, _~rAe.
The value of.~Ae is a complex function of the molecular-
diffusion characteristics of the substrate, the tortuousness
of the diffusion path within the solid, and the fraction of
the particle volume available for diffusion. We will
assume that .~rAeis constant and independent ofsubstrate
concentration in the particle; this means that ~Ae does
not change with position.
(iv) The particle is homogeneous. Immobilised enzymes or cells
are assumed to be distributed uniformly within the par-
ticle. Properties of the immobilisation matrix should also
be uniform.
(v) The substratepartition coefficient is unity. This assumption
is valid for most substrates and particles, and ensures
there is no discontinuity of concentration at the
solid-liquid interface.
(vi) The particle is at steady state. This assumption is usually
valid if there is no change in activity of the catalyst, for
example, due to enzyme deactivation, cell growth or dif-
ferentiation. It is not valid when the system exhibits rapid
transients such as when cells quickly consume and store
substrates for subsequent metabolism.
(i)
3OI
(vii) Substrate concentration varies with a single spatial variable.
For the sphere of Figure 12.4, we will assume that con-
centration varies only in the radial direction, and that
substrate diffuses radially through the particle from the
external surface towards the centre.
Eq. (4.1) is applied according to these assumptions.
Substrate is transported into and out of the shell by diffusion;
therefore, the first and second terms are expressed using Fick's
law with constant effective diffusivity. The third term is zero as
no substrate is generated. Substrate is consumed byreaction
inside the shell at a rate equal to the volumetric rate of reaction
r A multiplied by the volume of the shell. According to assump-
tion (vi) listed above, the system is at steady state. Thus, its
composition and mass must be unchanging, substrate cannot
accumulate in the shell, and the right-hand side of Eq. (4.1) is
zero. After substituting the appropriate expressions and apply-
ing calculus to reduce the dimensions of the shell to an
infinitesimal thickness, the result of the shell mass balance is a
second-order differential equation for substrate concentration
as a function of radius in the particle.
For a shell mass-balance on substrate A, the terms of Eq.
(4.1) are expressed as follows:

~Ae is the effective diffusivity ofsubstrate A, CA is the concen-
tration of A in the particle, ris distance measured radially from
the centre, Aris thickness of the shell, and rA is the rate of reac-
tion per unit volume particle. Each of the above terms has
dimensions MT -1 or NT -1 with units of, for example,
kg h -1 or gmol s-1. The first two terms are derived from
Fick's law of Eq. (9.1); the area of the spherical shell available
for diffusion is 4 x r 2. The term

Eq. (12.7) can be solved by integration to yield an expression
for the concentration profile in the particle: C A as a function of
r. However, we cannot integrate Eq. (12.7) as it stands because
the reaction rate r A is in most cases a function of C A. Let us
consider solutions of Eq. (12.7) with r A representing first-
order, zero-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

For first-order kinetics, Eq. (12.7) becomes:
d2CA r 2 + 2 r

Eq. (12.3) is valid for a spherical shell of thickness Ar. To
develop an equation which applies to any point in the sphere,
we must shrink Ar to zero. As Ar appears only in the first term
of Eq. (12.3), taking the limit of Eq. (12.3) as Ar--> 0 gives:

density of cells or enzyme in the particle. According to assump-
tions (i), (iii) and (iv) in Section 12.3.1, k 1 and "~Ae for a given
particle can be considered constant. Accordingly, as the only
variables in Eq. (12.8) are C A and r, the equation is ready for
integration. Because Eq. (12.8) is a second-order differential
equation we need two boundary conditions. These are:

Enzyme is immobilised in 8 m m diameter agarose beads at a concentration of 0.018 kg protein m -3 gel. Ten beads are
immersed in a well-mixed solution containing 3.2 • 10 -3 kg m -3 substrate. The effective diffusivity ofsubstrate in agarose gel is
2.1 • 10 -9 m 2 s- 1. Kinetics of the enzyme can be approximated as first order with specific rate constant 3.11 • 10 5 s- 1 per kg
protein. Mass transfer effects outside the particles are negligible. Plot the steady-state substrate concentration profile as a func-
tion of particle radius.
Solution:
R= 4 • 10 -3 m; "~Ae= 2.1 • 10 - 9 m 2 s - 1. In the absence of external mass-transfer effects, CAs = 3.2 • 10 -3 kg m -3.

where k 0 is the intrinsic zero-order rate constant with units of,

reactions, k 0 varies with cell or enzyme density in the catalyst.
Zero-order reactions are unique in that, provided substrate
is present, reaction rate is independent ofsubstrate concentra-
tion. In solving Eq. (12.13) we must account for the possibility
that substrate becomes depleted within the particle. As illus-
trated in Figure 12.5, if we assume this occurs at some radius
R 0, the rate of reaction for 0 < r ~ R 0 is zero. Everywhere else
inside the particle, i.e., r > R 0, the volumetric reaction rate is
constant and equal to k 0 irrespective of substrate concentra-
tion. For this situation the boundary conditions are:
Solution of Eq. (12.13) with these boundary conditions gives

In bioprocess applications, it is important that the core of cata-
lyst particles does not become starved of substrate. The
likelihood of this happening increases with size of the particle.
For zero-order reactions we can calculate the maximum parti-
cle radius for which CA remains > 0. In such a particle,
substrate is depleted just at the centre point. Therefore, calcu-

Non-viable yeast cells are immobilised in alginate beads. The beads are stirred in glucose medium under anaerobic conditions.

"~Ae = 6 . 3 3 - 7.17y c
where "~Ae is effective diffusivity • 101~ m 2 s -1 and Yc is the weight fraction of yeast in the gel. Rate of glucose uptake can be
assumed to be zero order; the rate constant at a yeast density in alginate of 15 wt% is 0.5 g 1-1 min- 1. For maximum reaction
rate, the concentration of glucose inside the particles should remain above zero.

restrictions. To ensure adequate supply ofsubstrate under these conditions, the particle size must be reduced.

where Vmax and K m are intrinsic kinetic parameters for the

its value depends on the concentration of cells or enzyme in
the particle.
Owing to the non-linearity of the Michaelis-Menten
expression, simple analytical integration of Eq. (12.18) is not
possible. However, results for CA as a function of r can be
obtained using numerical methods, usually by computer.

solutions found in Sections 12.3.2 and 12.3.3 can be used to
estimate the extreme limits for Michaelis-Menten reactions.
Concentration profiles calculated from the equations pre-
sented in this section have been verified experimentally in
several studies. Using special microelectrodes with tip diame-
ters of the order I tam, it is possible to measure concentrations
of oxygen and ions inside soft solids and cell slimes. As an
example, oxygen concentrations measured in immobilised-
enzyme beads are shown in Figure 12.6. The experimental
data are very close to the calculated concentration profiles.
Similar results have been found in other systems [8-10].
12.3.5 Concentration Profiles in Other
Geometries
Our attention so far has been focussed on spherical catalysts.
However, equations similar to Eq. (12.7) can be obtained
from shell mass balances on other geometries. Of all other
shapes, the one of most interest in bioprocessing is the flat
plate. A typical substrate concentration profile for this geome-
try without external boundary-layer effects is illustrated in
b
Figure 12.7. Equations for flat-plate geometry are used to ana-
lyse reactions in cell films attached to inert solids; the biofilm
constitutes the flat plate. Even if the surface supporting the
biofilm is curved rather than flat, if the film thickness b is very
small compared with the radius of curvature, equations for
flat-plate geometry are applicable. To simplify mathematical
treatment and keep the problem one-dimensional (as required
by assumption (vii) of Section 12.3.1), the flat plate is assumed
to have infinite length. In practice, this assumption is reason-
able if its length is much greater than its thickness. If not, it
must be assumed that the ends of the plate are sealed to elimi-
nate axial concentration gradients.
Another catalyst shape of some relevance to bioprocessing
is the hollow cylinder; this is useful in analysis of hollow-fibre
membrane reactors. However, because of its relatively limited
application, we will not consider this geometry further.
Concentration profiles for spherical and flat-plate geome-
tries and first- and zero-order kinetics are summarised in Table12 Heterogeneous

Prediction
of Observed
Reaction
Rate
Equations for intracatalyst substrate concentration such as
those in Table 12.1 allow us to predict overall rates of re'action.
Let us consider the situation for spherical particles and first-
order, zero-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Analogous
equations can be derived for other geometries.
(i)
First-order kinetics. Rate of reaction at any point in the
sphere depends on the first-order kinetic constant k I and
the concentration of substrate at that point. The overall
rate for the entire particle is equal to the sum of all such
rates at every location in the solid. This sum is mathemat-
ically equivalent to integrating the expression k 1 C a over
the entire particle volume, taking into account the varia-
tion of CA with radius expressed in Eq. (12.11). The
result is an equation for the observed reaction rate rA,obs

(ii) Zero-order kinetics. As long as substrate is present, zero-
order reactions occur at a fixed rate independent of
substrate concentration. Therefore, if C A > 0 everywhere
in the particle, the overall rate of reaction is equal to the
zero-order rate constant k 0 multiplied by the particle vol-
ume:
However, if C A falls to zero at some radius R 0, the inner
volume 4/3 It R30 is inactive. In this case, the rate of reac-
tion per particle is equal to k 0 multiplied by the active

explicitly because we do not have an equation for C A as a

using numerical methods.
12.4 The Thiele Modulus and Effectiveness
Factor
Charts based on the equations of the previous section allow us
to determine rA,obs relative to r ~ , the reaction rate that would
occur if all cells or enzyme were exposed to the external sub-
strate concentration. Differences between rA,obs and r ~ show
immediately the extent to which reaction is affected by
internal mass transfer. Comparison of these rates requires
application of theory as described in the following sections.

(12.26)
In the absence of mass-transfer limitations, rA,obs = r L and r/i
= 1; when mass-transfer effects reduce rA,obs, r/i < 1. For calcu-
lation of 7/i, rA,obs and r ~ should have the same units,
for example, kg s-1 m - 3 , gmol s-1 per particle, etc. We can
substitute expressions for rA,obs and r ~ from Eqs (12.21) and
(12.25) into Eq. (12.26) to derive an expression for r/il, the
internal effectiveness factor for first-order reaction:

First-Order Kinetics
Ifa catalyst particle is unaffected by mass transfer, the concen-
tration of substrate inside the particle is constant and equal to
the surface concentration, CAs. Thus, the rate of first-order
reaction without internal mass-transfer effects is equal to
k I CAs multiplied by the particle volume:
r/i -"
Thus, the internal effectiveness factor for first-order reaction
depends on only three parameters: R, k I and "~Ae" These
parameters are usually grouped together to form a dimension-
less variable called the Thiele modulus. There are several
definitions of the Thiele modulus in the literature; as it was
formulated originally [11], application of the modulus was
cumbersome because a separate definition was required for
different reaction kinetics and catalyst geometries.
Generalised moduli which apply to any catalyst shape and
reaction kinetics have since been proposed [ 12-14]. The geno
eralised Thiele modulus ~ is defined as:
R2kl
[R; kl/.~Ae coth (R~/kl/.~Ae ) -- 1].
(12.27)
where Vp is catalyst volume, S x is external surface area, C ~ is
substrate concentration at the surface of the catalyst, r A is
reaction rate, rAIC~ is the reaction rate When CA = CAs, _~rAeis
effective diffusivity of substrate and C A e- is the equilibrium
substrate concentration. As explained in ~ection 11.1.1, fer-
mentations and many enzyme reactions are irreversible so
that CA,eq is zero for most biological applications. From
geometry, Vp/sx = R/3 for spheres and b for flat plates.
Expressions determined from Eq. (12.28) for first-order,
zero-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics are listed in Table
12.2 as 01, #0 and r respectively. # represents a dimension-
less combination of the important parameters affecting mass
transfer and reaction in heterogeneous systems: catalyst size
(R or b), effective diffusivity ('~Ae)' surface concentration
(C~), and intrinsic rate parameters (k 0, k 1 or Vmax and Km).
Only the Thiele modulus for first'order reactions does not
depend on substrate concentration.
When parameters R, k 1 and "~Aein Eq. (12.27) are grouped
together as r the result is:

r/il = ~12 (3r

(12.29)
where coth is defined by Eq. (12.22). Eq. (12.29) applies to
spherical geometry and first-order reaction; an analogous
equation for flat plates is listed in Table 12.3. Plots of r/i I ver-
sus ~1 for sphere, cylinder and flat-plate catalysts are shown in

shape provided ~1 is calculated using Eq. (12.28). Because of
the errors involved in estimating the parameters defining ~01' it
ha~ been suggested that effectiveness factor curves be viewed as
diffuse bands rather than precise functions [ 15].
Thus, if the first-order Thiele modulus is known, we can
use Figure 12.8 to find the internal effectiveness factor and Eqs
(12.25) and (12.26) to predict the overall reaction rate for the
catalyst. At low values ofq~ 1 < 0.3, 0il = 1 and the rate ofreac-
tion is not adversely affected by internal mass transfer.
However as ~01 increases above 0.3, rtil falls as mass-transfer
limitations come into play. Therefore, the value of the ThieleI2 Heterogeneous Reactions

If CA falls to zero within the pellet, the effectiveness factor

According to the above analysis, to evaluate 1/i0 for zero-order
kinetics, first we must know whether or not substrate is
depleted in the catalyst, then, if it is, the value of R 0. Usually
this information is unavailable because we cannot easily meas-
ure intraparticle concentrations. Fortunately, further
mathematical analysis [7] overcomes this problem by repre-
senting the system in terms of measurable properties such as R,
"@'ae' CAs and k 0 rather than R0. These parameters define the
Thiele modulus for zero-order reaction, #0" The results are
summarised in Table 12.3 and Figure 12.9. CA remains > 0 and
0i0 = 1 for 0 < #0 ~< 0.577 ; for #0 > 0.577, 0i0 declines as more

We can obtain approximate values for r/im by considering
the zero- and first-order asymptotes of the Michaelis-Menten
equation. As indicated in Figure 12.10, curves for rlim fall

Figure 12.9 apply with k 0 - Vma~. Effectiveness factors for 13
between zero and infinity must be evaluated using numerical
methods. Use of the generalised Thiele modulus as defined in
Table 12.2 eliminates almost all variation in the internal
effectiveness factor with changing/3, except in the vicinity of
~)m -- 1. AS in Figures 12.8 and 12.9, the generalised modulus
also brings together effectiveness-factor curves for all shapes
of catalyst at the two asymptotes ~m --) 0 and ~m --') oo.
Therefore, Figure 12.10 is valid for spherical catalysts if # m is
much less or much greater than 1. It should be noted however
that variation between geometries in the intermediate region

If values of ~m and/3 are such that Michaelis-Menten

occurs at ~m = 1 and 13 = 0.2. For spherical geometry, the
greatest deviations occur around ~)m = 1.7 a n d / 3 - 0.3; the
maximum error in this region is 0.09. Further details can be
found in the original paper [ 17].

12.4.4 The Observable Thiele Modulus
Diffusion-reaction theory as presented in the previous sections
allows us to quantify the effect of mass transfer on rate of reac-
tion. However, a drawback to the methods outlined so far is
that they are useful only if we know the true kinetic parameters
for the reaction: k 0, k I or Vmax and K m. In many cases these
values are not known and, as discussed in Section 12.9, can be
difficult to evaluate for biological systems. A way to circum-
vent this problem is to apply the
sometimes called
[ 18], which is defined as:

where Vp is catalyst volume, Sx is external surface area, r A obs
is ~he observed reaction rate per unit volume of catalyst, --~A~is
effective diffusivity of substrate, and C~ is the substrate con-
centration at the external surface. Expressions for 9 for
spheres and flat plates are listed in Table 12.4. Evaluation of
the observable Thiele modulus does not rely on prior knowl-
edge of kinetic parameters; 9 is defined in terms of the
measured reaction rate, rA,obs.
For the observable Thiele modulus to be useful, we need to
relate 9 to the internal effectiveness factor 0i. Some mathe-
matical consideration of the equations already presented in
this chapter yields the following relationships for first-order,
zero-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics:

12.12 for Michaelis-Menten reactions requires knowledge of
K m for evaluation of ft. This makes application of the observ-
able Thiele modulus difficult for Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
However, we know that effectiveness factors for
Michaelis-Menten reactions lie between the first- and zero-
order curves of Figures 12.11 and 12.12; therefore, we can
always estimate the upper and lower bounds of 7/im"
Example
12.4
The following general observations can be made from Figures
12.11 and 12.12.
If 9 < 0.3, r/i = 1 and internal mass-transfer limitations are
insignificant.
If 9 > 3, o i is substantially < 1 and internal mass-transfer
limitations are significant.
The above statements are known as Weisz's criteria, and are
valid for all geometries and reaction kinetics. For 9 in the
intermediate range 0.3 < 9 < 3, closer analysis is required to
determine the influence of mass transfer on reaction rate.
Internal oxygen transfer to immobilised
cells
Baby hamster kidney cells are immobilised in alginate beads. The average particle diameter is 5 mm. Rate of oxygen consump-
tion at a bulk concentration of 8 x 10 -3 kg 0 2 m -3 is 8.4 x 10 -5 kg s- 1m - 3 catalyst. The effective diffusivity ofoxygen in the
beads is 1.88 x 10 -9 m 2 s- 1. Assume that the oxygen concentration at the surface of the catalyst is equal to the bulk concentra-
tion, and that oxygen uptake follows zero-order kinetics.
(a) Are internal mass-transfer effects significant?
(b) What reaction rate would be observed ifdiffusional resistance were eliminated?

12.4.6 Minimum Intracatalyst Substrate
Concentration
It is sometimes of interest to know the minimum concentra-
tion CA, mi n inside solid catalysts. We can use this information
to check, for example, that the concentration does not fall
below some critical value for cell metabolism. CA, mi n is easily
estimated for zero-order reactions. If 9 is such that r/i < 1,
CA,min is zero because r/i= 1 if C A > 0 throughout the particle.
F o r r/i = 1, simple manipulation of the equations already pre-
sented in this chapter allow us to e s t i m a t e CA, mi n. The results
are summarised in Table 12.5.
Table 12.5
12.5 External Mass Transfer
Many equations in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 contain the term
C~, the concentration of substrate A at the external surface of
the catalyst. This term made its way into the analysis in the
boundary conditions used for solution of the shell mass balance.
It was assumed that C ~ is a known quantity. However, because
surface concentrations are very difficult to measure accurately,
we must find ways to estimate C ~ using theoretical principles.
Reduction in substrate concentration from CAb in the bulk
liquid to C ~ at the catalyst surface occurs across the boundary
layer surrounding the solid. In the absence of the boundary

layer, CAS = CAb, which is easily measured. When the bound-
ary layer is present, CAStakes some value less than CAb. Rate of
mass transfer across a liquid boundary layer is represented by
the following equation (Section 9.4):
N A = k S a(CAb -- GAS)
(12.41)
where N A is the rate of mass transfer, k s is the liquid-phase
mass-transfer co~r
with dimensions LT-1, and a is the
external surface area of the catalyst. If N A is expressed per vol-
ume of catalyst with units of, for example, kgmol s-1 m-3, to
be consistent, a must also be expressed on a catalyst-volume
basis with units of, for example, m 2 m -3 or m-1. Using the
previous notation of this chapter, a in Eq. (12.41) is equal to
sd Vpfor the catalyst. At steady state, the rate ofsubstrate trans-
fer across the boundary layer must be equal to the rate of
consumption by the catalyst, r&obs. Therefore:

external mass-transfer effects can be gauged from Eq. (12.43).
CAs/CAb = 1 indicates no external mass-transfer limitations;
the substrate concentration at the surface is a~proximately
equal to that in the bulk. On the other hand, AS~CAb<< 1
indicates a very steep concentration gradient in the boundary
layer and severe external mass-transfer effects. We can define
from Eq. (12.43) an observable modulus for external mass
transfer, 12:

Expressions for 0e for first-order, zero-order and

order reactions, as long as CAs and CAb > 0, 77e0= 1. However,
r/e0 = 1 does not imply that an external boundary layer does
not exist; even if there is a reduction in concentration across
the boundary layer, because r ~ and r~b are independent of
C A, 7/e0 = 1. Furthermore, 77e0= 1 does not imply that elimi-
nating the external boundary layer could not improve the
reaction rate. Removing the boundary layer would increase the
value of CAs, thus establishing a greater driving force for
internal mass-transfer and reducing the likelihood of CA fall-
ing to zero inside the particle.
Example 12.5 Effect of mass transfer on bacterial denitrification
Denitrifying bacteria are immobilised in gel beads and used in a stirred reactor for removal of nitrate from groundwater. At a
nitrate concentration of 3 g m -3, the conversion rate is 0.011 g s-1 m - 3 catalyst. The effective diffusivity ofnitrate in the gel is
1.5 • 10 -9 m 2 s-1, the beads are 6 mm in diameter, and the liquid-solid mass-transfer coefficient is 10 -5 m s-1. Km for the
immobilised bacteria is approximately 25 g m -3.
(a) Does external mass transfer influence the reaction rate?
(b) Are internal mass-transfer effects significant?

Correlations
The mass-transfer coefficient k s must be known before we can
account for external mass-transfer effects, k s depends on reac-
tor hydrodynamics and liquid properties such as viscosity,
density and diffusivity. It is difficult to determine k s accur-
ately, especially for particles which are neutrally buoyant.
However, values can be estimated using correlations from the
literature; these are usually accurate under the conditions speci-
fied to within 10-20%. Selected correlations are presented
below. Further details can be found in chemical engineering
texts [ 19, 20].
Correlations for k s are expressed using the following
dimensionless groups:

physical properties of the system. At constant temperature, pres-
sure and composition, Sc is constant for Newtonian fluids. The
Grashof number represents the ratio of gravitational forces to
viscous forces, and is important when the particles are neutrally
buoyant. The form of the correlation used to evaluate Sh and
therefore k s depends on the configuration of the mass-transfer
system, the flow conditions and other factors.

The equations presented here apply to solid particles suspend-
ed in stirred vessels. Rate of mass transfer depends on the
velocity of the solid relative to the liquid; this is known as the
slip velocity. Slip velocity in suspensions is difficult to measure
and must therefore be estimated before calculating k s . The fol-
lowing equations allow evaluation of the particle Reynolds
number which incorporates the slip velocity, Upl. [7]"

12.7 Experimental Aspects
Applying diffusion-reaction theory to real biocatalysts requires
prior measurement of several parameters. This section consid-
ers some experimental aspects of heterogeneous reactions.

Calculation of Weisz's modulus O and the external modulus
/'2 requires knowledge of rA,obs, the observed rate of reaction
per volume of catalyst. This information can be obtained from
batch concentration data using the methods described in
Section 11.2.
When substrate levels change relatively slowly during reac-
tion, batch rate data can be obtained by removing samples of
the reaction mixture at various times and analysing for sub-
strate concentration. However ifsubstrate is consumed rapidly
or if oxygen uptake rates are required, continuous in situ mon-
itoring is necessary. The equipment shown in Figure 12.13 is
configured for measurement of oxygen consumption by
immobilised cells or enzymes. Catalyst particles are packed
into a column and liquid medium recirculated through the
packed bed. Oxygen is sparged into a stirred vessel connected
to the column; dissolved-oxygen tension is measured using an
electrode. The catalyst is allowed to reach steady state at a
particular oxygen tension; the gas supply is then switched off
and the initial rate of oxygen uptake recorded. Observed rates
must be measured at steady state so that the results do not
reflect rapidly-changing transient conditions. Unless sufficient
time is allowed for the system to establish steady state, the
experimental results will be unreliable.
The system of Figure 12.13 is assumed to be well mixed so
that the oxygen tension measured by the electrode is the same
everywhere in the bulk liquid. Actually, oxygen concentrations
entering and leaving the packed bed will be different because
oxygen is consumed by the catalyst. However, if only 1-2% of
the oxygen entering the column is consumed during each pass
through the bed, from a practical point of view the system can
be regarded as perfectly mixed. For this to occur, the recircula-
tion flow rate must be sufficiently high [24]. In oxygen uptake
experiments, temperature control is also very important as the
solubility and mass-transfer properties of oxygen are tempera-
ture dependent (see Sections 9.6.4 and 9.8.2).
Observed reaction rates for catalytic reactions depend on
the cell or enzyme loading per volume of catalyst. Therefore,
experimental measurements apply only to the cell or enzyme
density tested. Increasing the amount of cells or enzyme in the
catalyst will increase rA,obs and the likelihood of mass-transfer
restrictions.

12.7.2 Effective Diffusivity
The value of the effective diffusivity ~Ae reflects the ease with
which compound A diffuses within the catalyst matrix, and
depends strongly on the pore structure of the solid. Effective
diffusivities are normally lower than corresponding molecular
diffusivities in water because porous solids offer more resist-
ance to diffusion. Some experimental "~Ae values are given in
Table 12.8.
As cells can pose a significant barrier to diffusion, ~Ae for
immobilised-cell preparations must be determined with the
biomass present. During the measurement, external mass-
transfer limitations must be overcome with high liquid flow
rates around the catalyst. If experimental values of ~Ae are
higher than the molecular diffusion coefficient, this may indi-
cate the presence of convective mass transfer in the catalyst
[3-6]. Techniques for measuring effective diffusivity are
described in several papers [28-33]; however, accurate meas-
urement of~Ae is difficult in most systems.
12.8 Minimising Mass-Transfer Effects
To improve overall rates of reaction in bioprocesses, mass-
transfer restrictions must be minimised or eliminated. In this
section we consider practical ways of achieving this objective
based on the equations presented in Tables 12.4 and 12.6.
12.8.1 Internal Mass Transfer
Internal mass-transfer effects are eliminated when the internal
effectiveness factor is equal to 1; 0i approaches unity as the
observable Thiele modulus 9 is reduced. From Table 12.4,

(i) reducing the observed reaction rate rA,obs;
(ii) reducing the size of the catalyst;
(iii) increasing the effective diffusivity ~Ae; and
(iv) increasing the surface concentration ofsubstrate CAs.
All these changes impact directly on the effectiveness of mass
transfer in supplying substrate to the particle.
Paradoxically, reducing the reaction rate rA,obs improves
the effectiveness of mass transfer aimed at increasing the reac-
tion rate. When the catalyst is very active with a high demand
for substrate, mass transfer is likely to be slow relative to reac-
tion so that steep concentration gradients are produced.
However, limiting the reaction rate by operating at sub-opti-
mum conditions or using an organism or enzyme with low
intrinsic activity does not achieve the overall goal of higher
conversion rates. Because rA,obs is the reaction rate per volume
of catalyst, another way of reducing rA,obs is to reduce the cell
or enzyme loading in the solid. This reduces the demand for
substrate per particle so that mass transfer has a better chance
of supplying it at a sufficient rate. Therefore, if the same mass
of cells or enzyme is distributed between more particles, the
rate of conversion will increase. However, using more particles
may mean that a larger reactor is required.
Because 9 is proportional to the square of catalyst size (R 2
for spheres or b 2 for flat plates), reducing the catalyst size has a
more dramatic effect on q~ than changes in any other variable.
It is therefore a good way to improve the reaction rate. In prin-
ciple, mass-transfer limitations can be completely overcome if
the particle size is decreased sufficiently. However, it is often
extremely difficult in practice to reduce particle dimensions to
this extent [34]. Even if mass-transfer effects were eliminated,
operation of large-scale reactors with tiny, highly compressible
gel particles raises new problems. Some degree of internal
mass-transfer restriction must usually be tolerated.
12.8.2 External Mass T r a n s f e r
External mass-transfer effects decrease as the observable mod-
ulus/2 is reduced. From the equations in Table 12.6, this can
be achieved by:
(i) reducing the observed reaction rate rA,obs;
(ii) reducing the size of the catalyst;
(iii) increasing the mass-transfer coefficient ks; and
(iv) increasing the bulk concentration ofsubstrate CAb.
Decreasing the catalyst size and increasing the mass-transfer
coefficient reduce the thickness of the boundary layer and facili-
tate external mass transfer, k s is increased most readily by raising
the liquid velocity outside the catalyst, k s is a function of other
system properties such as liquid viscosity, density, and substrate

diffusivity; changes in these variables can also reduce boundary-
layer effects to some extent. External mass transfer is more rapid
at high bulk substrate concentrations; the higher the concentra-
tion, the greater is the driving force for mass transfer across the
boundary layer. By reducing the demand for substrate transfer
across the boundary layer, decreasing rA,obs as described in the
previous section also reduces external limitations.
In large-scale reactors, external mass-transfer problems may
be unavoidable if sufficiently high liquid velocities cannot be
achieved. However, when evaluating biocatalyst kinetics in
the laboratory, it is advisable to eliminate fluid boundary layers
to simplify analysis of the data. Several laboratory reactor con-
figurations allow almost complete elimination of interparticle
and interphase concentration gradients [35]. Recycle reactors
such as that shown in Figure 12.13 have been employed exten-
sively for study of immobilised cell and enzyme reactions;
operation with high liquid velocity through the bed reduces12 Heterogeneous Reactions

boundary-layer effects. Another suitable configuration is the
spinning-basket reactor [36, 37] illustrated in Figure 12.14. By
rotating the baskets at high speed, high relative velocity is
achieved between the particles and the surrounding fluid. Slip
velocities obtained using this apparatus are significantly
greater than with freely-suspended particles. Another labora-
tory design aimed at increasing the slip velocity is the stirred
vessel shown in Figure 12.15. In this vessel, catalyst particles
are held relatively stationary in a wire-mesh cage while liquid is
agitated at high speed.
Elimination of external mass-transfer effects can be verified
by calculating the observable parameter /-2 as described in
Section 12.5. However, if the mass-transfer coefficient is not
known accurately, an experimental test may be used instead
[24]. Consider again the apparatus of Figure 12.13. If boundary
layers around the particles affect the reaction, increased liquid
velocity through the bed will improve conversion rates by reduc-
ing the film thickness and bringing C~ closer to CAB. As
illustrated in Figure 12.16, at sufficiently high liquid velocity,
external mass-transfer effects can be removed using this proce-
dure; further increases in pump speed do not change the overall
reaction rate. Therefore, if we can identify a liquid velocity u [ at
which reaction rate becomes independent of liquid velocity,
operation at u L > u *L will ensure that r/e = 1. For stirred reactors,
a similar relationship holds between rA,obs and agitation speed.
12.9 Evaluating True Kinetic Parameters
The intrinsic kinetics of zero-order, first-order, and
Michaelis-Menten reactions are represented by the parame-
Liquid velocity, u L
ters k 0, k 1, Vmax and K m. In general, it cannot be assumed that
the values of these parameters will be the same before and after
cell or enzyme immobilisation; significant changes can be
wrought during the immobilisation process. As an example,
Figure 12.17 shows Lineweaver-Burk plots for free and
immobilised 3-galactosidase enzyme. According to Eq.
(11.37), the slopes and intercepts of the lines in Figure 12.17
indicate values of Km/Vma~ and 1/ Vmax, respectively. The steep-
er slopes and higher intercepts obtained for the immobil-
ised enzyme indicate that immobilisation reduces Vma~;this
is a commonly observed result. The value of K m can also be
affected [9].
As described in Sections 11.3 and 11.4, kinetic parameters
for homogeneous reactions can be determined directly from
experimental rate data. However, evaluating the true kinetic
parameters of immobilised cells and enzymes is somewhat
more difficult. The observed rate of reaction is not the true rate
at all points in the catalyst; mass-transfer processes effectively
'mask' true kinetic behaviour. For example, Vmax and K m for
immobilised catalysts cannot be estimated using the classical
plots described in Section 11.4; under the influence of mass
transfer, these plots no longer give straight lines over the entire
range ofsubstrate concentration [38, 39].
As illustrated in Figure 12.17 for /3-galactosidase,
Lineweaver-Burk plots for immobilised enzymes are non-
linear; the shape and slope of the curves depend on the
magnitude of the Thiele modulus. Deviation from linearity in
such plots is easily obscured by the scatter in real experimental
data and the distortion of errors due to the Lineweaver-Burk
linearisation. At low substrate concentrations, i.e. large valuesI2, Heterogeneous Reactions

Several methods have been proposed for determining Vmax
and K m in heterogeneous catalysts [38-41]. The most
straightforward approach is experimental; it involves reducing
the particle size and catalyst loading and increasing the exter-
nal liquid velocity to eliminate all mass-transfer resistances.
Measured rate data can then be analysed for kinetic parameters
as if the reaction were homogeneous. However, because it is
usually very difficult or impossible to completely remove
intraparticle effects, procedures involving a series of experi-
ments coupled with theoretical analysis have also been
proposed. In these methods, rate data are collected at high and
low substrate concentrations using different particle sizes. At
high substrate levels, it is assumed that the reaction is zero
order with 0i = 1; at low concentrations, first-order kinetics are
assumed. These assumptions simplify the analysis, but may
not always be valid.
When adequate computing facilities are available, true
values of Vmax and K m can be extracted from diffusion-limited
data using iterative calculations based on numerical integra-
tion and non-linear regression [7, 9]. Many iteration loops
may be required before convergence to the final parameter
values.
s
of 1/s, the Lineweaver-Burk plot appears linear as first-order
kinetics are approached. Even ifwe mistakenly interpret one of
the immobilised-enzyme curves in Figure 12.17 as a straight
line and evaluate apparent values of Vmax and K m, we can
check whether or not we have found the true kinetic para-
meters by changing the particle radius and substrate
concentration over a wide range of values. True kinetic para-
meters do not vary with these conditions which affect mass
transfer into the catalyst; if the slope and/or intercept change
with Thiele modulus, it is soon evident that the system is sub-
ject to diffusional limitations. Thus, apparent linearity of
Lineweaver-Burk or similar plots is insufficient demonstra-
tion of the absence of mass-transfer restrictions. Studies have
shown that the effect of diffusion is more pronounced in
Eadie-Hofstee plots than Lineweaver-Burk or Langmuir
plots [39]; however, all three can be approximated by straight
lines over certain intervals.
Although the Lineweaver-Burk plot for immobilised
3-galactosidase is non-linear, we should not conclude
that immobilised enzymes fail to obey Michaelis-Menten
kinetics. The kinetic form of reactions is generally maintained
upon immobilisation of cells and enzymes [9]; non-linearity
of the Lineweaver-Burk plot is due to the effect of mass
transfer on rA,obs.
12.10 General Comments on Heterogeneous
R e a c t i o n s in B i o p r o c e s s i n g
Before concluding this chapter, some general observations and
rules of thumb for heterogeneous reactions are outlined.
(i)
Importance of oxygen mass-transfer limitations. In aerobic
reactions, mass transfer of oxygen is more likely to limit
reaction rate than mass transfer of most other substrates.
The reason is the poor solubility of oxygen in aqueous
solutions. Whereas the sugar concentration in a typical
fermentation broth is around 20-50 kg m -3, oxygen
concentration under I atm air pressure is limited to about
8 • 10 -3 kg m -3. Therefore, because C~ is so low for
oxygen, the observable Thiele modulus 9 can be several
orders of magnitude greater than for other substrates. In
anaerobic systems, the rate-limiting substrate is more dif-
ficult to identify.
(ii) Relationship between internal effectivenessfactor and concen-
tration gradient. Depending on the reaction kinetics, the
severity of intraparticle concentration gradients can be
inferred from the value of the internal effectiveness factor.
For first-order kinetics, reaction rate is directly propor-
tional to substrate concentration; therefore 0 il = 1 implies
that concentration gradients do not exist in the catalyst.
Conversely, if Oi I < I we can conclude that concentration12 Heterogeneous Reactions
gradients are present. In contrast, for zero-order reactions
77i0= 1 does not imply that gradients are absent; as long as
CA > 0, the reaction rate is unaffected. Concentration gra-
dients can be so steep that CA is reduced to almost zero
within the catalyst, but rli0 remains equal to 1. On the
other hand, 17i0< 1 implies that the concentration gradient
is very severe and that some fraction of the particle volume
is starved ofsubstrate.
(iii) Relative importance of internal and external mass-transfir
limitations. For porous catalysts, it has been demon-
strated with realistic values of mass transfer and diffusion
parameters that external mass-transfer limitations do not
exist unless internal limitations are also present [42].
Concentration differences between the bulk liquid and
external catalyst surface are never observed without larger
internal gradients developing within the particle. On the
other hand, if internal limitations are known to be
present, external limitations may or may not be import-
ant depending on conditions. Significant external
mass-transfer effects can occur when reaction does not
take place inside the catalyst, for example, if cells or
enzymes are attached only to the exterior surface.
(iv) Operation of catalytic reactors. Certain solid-phase proper-
ties are desirable for operation of immobilised-cell and
-enzyme reactors. For example, in packed-bed reactors,
large, rigid and uniformly-shaped particles promote well-
distributed and stable liquid flow. Solids in packed
columns should also have sufficient mechanical strength
to withstand their own weight. These requirements are in
direct conflict with those needed for rapid intraparticle
mass transfer; diffusion is facilitated in particles that are
small, soft and porous. Because blockages and large
pressure drops through the bed must be avoided,
mass-transfer rates are usually compromised. In stirred
reactors, soft, porous gels are readily destroyed at the
agitation speeds needed to eliminate external boundary-
layer effects.
(v) Product qCfects. Products formed by reaction inside cata-
lysts must diffuse out under the influence of a
concentration gradient. The concentration profile for
product is the reverse of that for substrate; concentration
is highest at the centre of the catalyst'and lowest in the
bulk liquid. If product inhibition affects cell or enzyme
activity, high intraparticle concentrations may inhibit
progress of the reaction. Immobilised enzymes which
produce or consume H § ions are often affected; because
enzyme reactions are very sensitive to pH, small local
variations due to slow diffusion of ions can have a sig-
nificant influence on reaction rate [43].

waste treatment lagoon
Industrial wastewater is often treated in large shallow lagoons.
Consider such a lagoon covering land of area A.
Microorganisms form a sludge layer of thickness L at the bot-
tom of the lagoon; this sludge remains essentially undisturbed
by movement of the liquid. As indicated in Figure 12P1.1, dis-
tance from the bottom of the lagoon is measured by
coordinate z. Assume that microorganisms are distributed
uniformly in the sludge.

Recombinant E. coli cells contain a plasmid derived from
pBR322 incorporating genes for the enzymes/3-1actamase and
catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonasputida. To pro-
duce the desired enzymes the organism requires aerobic
conditions. The cells are immobilised in spherical beads ofcar-
rageenan gel. The effective diffusivity of oxygen is 1.4 x
10 -9 m 2 s-1. Uptake of oxygen is zero-order with intrinsic
rate constant 10 -3 mol s-1 m - 3 particle. The concentration
of oxygen at the surface of the catalyst is 8 x 10 -3 kg m -3.
Cell growth is negligible.

tions throughout the catalyst?
(b) For particles half the diameter calculated in (a), what is the
minimum oxygen concentration in the beads?

12.4 Ammonia oxidation by immobilised cells
Thiosphaerapantotropha is being investigated for aerobic oxi-
dation of ammonia to nitrite in wastewater treatment. The
organism is immobilised in spherical agarose particles of diam-
eter 3 mm. The effective diffusivity of oxygen in the particles is
1.9 x 10 -9 m 2 s- 1. The immobilised cells are placed in a flow
chamber for measurement of oxygen uptake rate. Using pub-
lished correlations, the liquid-solid mass-transfer coefficient
for oxygen is calculated as 6 x 10 -5 m s-1. When the bulk
oxygen concentration is 6 x 10 -3 kg m -3, the observed rate of
oxygen consumption is 2.2 x 10 -5 kg s -1 m -3 catalyst.
(a) What effect does external mass-transfer have on respira-
tion rate?

be kept above the critical level, 1.2 x 10-3 kg m-3. Is this
condition satisfied?

serum-flee medium of viscosity 10 -3 N s m -2 and density
103 kg m-3. The diffusivity of oxygen in the medium is 2.3 x
10 -9 m2s -1. The observed rate of oxygen uptake is

0.2 mol m -3. What is the effect of external mass transfer on
reaction rate?

Invertase from Aspergillus oryzae is immobilised in porous
resin particles of diameter 1.6 mm at a density of 0.1 lamol
enzyme g-1. The effective diffusivity of sucrose in the resin is
1.3 • 10-11 m 2 s-1. The resin is placed in a spinning-basket
reactor operated so that external mass-transfer effects are elim-
inated. At a sucrose concentration of 0.85 k g m -3, the

Suspended Catharanthus roseus cells form spherical clumps
approximately 1.5 mm in diameter. Oxygen uptake is meas-
ured using the apparatus of Figure 12.13; medium is
recirculated with a superficial liquid velocity of 0.83 cm s-1.
At a bulk concentration of 8 mg l-1, oxygen is consumed at a
rate of 0.28 mg per g wet weight per hour. Assume that the
density and viscosity of the medium are similar to water, the
specific gravity of wet cells is 1, and oxygen uptake is zero
order. The effective diffusivity of oxygen in the clumps is 9 •
10-6 cm 2 s- 1, or half that in the medium.

Aspergillus niger cells are observed to form aggregates of aver-
age diameter 5 ram. The effective diffusivity of oxygen in the
aggregates is 1.75 • 10 -9 m 2 s-:. In a fixed-bed reactor, the
oxygen-consumption rate at a bulk oxygen concentration of
8 • 10 -3 kg m -3 is 8.7 • 10 -5 kgs -1 m -3 biomass. The

Reactor Engineering
The reactor is the heart of anyfermentation or enzyme conversion process. Design of bioreactors is a complex task, relying on
scientific and engineeringprinciples and many rules of thumb. Specifying aspects of the reactor and its operation involves
several critical decisions.
Reactorconfiguration. For example, should the reactor be
a stirred tank or an air-driven vessel without mechanical
agitation?
(ii) Reactorsize. What size reactor is required to achieve the
desired rate of production?
(iii) Processing conditions inside the reactor. What reaction
conditions such as temperature, pH and dissolved-
oxygen tension should be maintained in the vessel, and
how will these parameters be controlled? How will con-
tamination be avoided?
(iv) Mode of operation. Will the reactor be operated batch-
wise or as a continuous-flow process? Should substrate be
fed intermittently? Should the reactor be operated alone
or in series with others?
(i)
Decisions made in reactor design have a significant impact on
overall process performance, yet there are no simple or stan-
dard design procedures available which specify all aspects of
the vessel and its operation. Reactor engineering brings
together much of the material already covered in Chapters
7-12 of this book. Knowledge of reaction kinetics is essential
for understanding how biological reactors work. Other areas
of bioprocess engineering such as mass and energy balances,
mixing, mass transfer and heat transfer are also required.

Engineering
in Perspective
Before starting to design a reactor, some objectives have to be
defined. Simple aims like 'Produce 1 g of monoclonal anti-
body per day', or 'Produce 10 000 tonnes of amino acid per
year', provide the starting point. Other objectives are also rele-
vant; in industrial processes the product should be made at the
lowest possible cost to maximise the company's commercial
advantage. In some cases, economic objectives are overridden
by safety concerns, the need for high-product purity or regula-
tory considerations. The final reactor design will be a reflec-
tion of all these process requirements and, in most cases,
represents a compromise solution to conflicting demands.
In this section, we will consider the various contributions
to bioprocessing costs for different types of product, and
examine the importance of reactor engineering in improving
overall process performance. As shown in Figure 13.1, the
value of products made by bioprocessing covers a wide range.
Typically, products with the highest value are those from
Figure 13.1 Range ofvalue offermentation products.

mammalian cell culture, such as therapeutic proteins and
monoclonal antibodies. At the opposite end of the scale is
treatment of waste, where the overriding objective is minimal
financial outlay for the desired level of purity. To reduce the
cost of any bioprocess, it is first necessary to identify which
aspect of it is cost-determining. Break-down of production
costs varies from process to process; however, a general scheme
is shown in Figure 13.2. The following components are
important: (i) research and development; (ii) the fermentation
or reaction step; (iii) downstream processing; and (iv) admin-
istration and marketing. In most bioprocesses, the cost of
administration and marketing is relatively small. Products for
which the cost of reaction dominates include biomass such as
bakers' yeast and single-cell protein, catabolic metabolites
such as ethanol and lactic acid, and bioconversion products
such as high-fructose corn syrup and 6-aminopenicillanic
acid. Intracellular products such as proteins have high down-
stream-processing costs compared with reaction; other
examples in this category are antibiotics, vitamins and amino
acids. For new, high-value biotechnology products such as
recombinant proteins and antibodies, actual processing costs
are only a small part of the total because of the enormous
investment required for research and development and regula-
tory approval. Getting the product into the marketplace
quickly is the most important cost-saving measure in these
cases; any savings made by improving the efficiency of the
reactor are generally trivial in comparison. However, for the
majority of fermentation products outside this high-value
category, bioprocessing costs make a significant contribution
to the final price.
If the reaction step dominates the cost structure, this may
be because of the high cost of the raw materials required or the
high cost of reactor operation. The relative contributions of
these factors depends on the process. As an example, to pro-
duce high-value antibiotics, the cost of 100 m 3 media is
US$25 000-100 000 [1]. In contrast, the cost of energy, i.e.
electricity, to operate a 100 m 3 stirred-tank fermenter includ-
ing agitation, air compression and cooling water for a 6-d
antibiotic fermentation is about US$8000 [ 1, 2]. Clearly then,
energy costs for reactor operation are much less important
than raw-material costs for this fermentation process. For
high-value, low-yield products such as antibiotics, vitamins,
enzymes and pigments, media represents 60-90% of the fer-
mentation costs [ 1]. For low-cost, high-yield metabolites suchI3 Reactor E

as ethanol, citric acid, biomass and lactic acid, raw material
costs range from 400/0 of fermentation costs for citric acid to
about 700/0 for ethanol produced from molasses [1, 3]. The
remainder of the operating cost of bioreactors consists mainly
of labour and utilities costs.
As indicated in Figure 13.3, identifying the cost structure
of bioprocesses assists in defining the objectives for reactor
design. Even if the reaction itself is not cost-determining,
aspects of reactor design may still be important. If the cost of
research and development is dominating, design of the reactor
is directed towards the need for rapid scale-up; this is more
important than maximising conversion or minimising operat-
ing costs. For new biotechnology products intended for
therapeutic use, regulatory guidelines require that the entire
production scheme be validated and process control guaran-
teed for consistent quality and safety; reproducibility of
reactor operation is therefore critical. When the cost of raw
materials is significant, maximising substrate conversion and
product yield in the reactor have high priority. If downstream
processing is expensive, the reactor is designed and operated to
maximise the product concentration leaving the vessel; this
avoids the expense of recovering product from dilute solu-
tions. When reaction costs are significant, the reactor should
be as small as possible to reduce both operating and capital
costs. To achieve the desired total production rate using a
small vessel, the volumetric productivity of the reactor must be
sufficiently high (see Section 11.1.3).
As indicated in Figure 13.3, volumetric productivity
depends on the concentration of catalyst and its specific rate of
production. To achieve high volumetric rates, the reactor
must therefore allow maximum catalyst activity at the highest
practical catalyst concentration. For tightly packed cells or cell
organelles, the physical limit on concentration is of the order
200 kg dry weight m-3; for enzymes in solution, the maxi-
mum concentration depends on the solubility of enzyme in
the reaction mixture. The extent to which these limiting con-
centrations can be approached depends on the functioning of
the reactor. For example, if mixing or mass transfer is inade-
quate, oxygen or nutrient starvation will occur and the
maximum cell density achieved will be low. Alternatively, if
shear levels in the reactor are too high, cells will be disrupted
and enzymes inactivated so that the effective concentration of
catalyst is reduced.
Maximum specific productivity is obtained when the cata-
lyst is capable of high levels of production and conditions in
the reactor allow the best possible catalytic function. ForI3 ReactorE

simple metabolites such as ethanol, butanol and acetic acid
which are linked to energy production in the cell, the maxi-
mum theoretical yield is limited by the thermodynamic and
stoichiometric principles outlined in Section 4.6.
Accordingly, there is little scope for increasing production
titres of these materials; reduced production costs and com-
mercial advantage rely mostly on improvements in reactor
operation which allow the system to achieve close to the maxi-
mum theoretical yield. In contrast, it is not unusual for
strain improvement and media optimisation programmes to
improve yields of antibiotics and enzymes by over 100-fold,
particularly in the early stages of process development.
Therefore, for these products, identification of high-produc-
ing strains and optimal environmental conditions is initially
more rewarding than improving the reactor design and opera-
tion.

Typical stirred-tank fermenter for aerobic
13.2 Bioreactor Configurations
The cylindrical tank, either stirred or unstirred, is the most
common reactor in bioprocessing. Yet, a vast array of ferment-
er configurations is in use in different bioprocess industries.
Novel bioreactors are constantly being developed for special
applications and new forms of biocatalyst such as plant and
animal tissue and immobilised cells and enzymes.
Much of the challenge in reactor design lies in the provision
of adequate mixing and aeration for the large proportion of
fermentations requiring oxygen; reactors for anaerobic culture
are usually very simple in construction without sparging or
agitation. In the following discussion of bioreactor configura-
tions, aerobic operation will be assumed.
13.2.1 Stirred Tank
A conventional stirred, aerated bioreactor is shown schemati-
cally in Figure 13.4. Mixing and bubble dispersion are
achieved by mechanical agitation; this requires a relatively
high input of energy per unit volume. Baffles are used in
stirred reactors to reduce vortexing. A wide variety of impeller
sizes and shapes is available to produce different flow patterns
inside the vessel; in tall fermenters, installation of multiple
impellers improves mixing. The mixing and mass-transfer
functions of stirred reactors are described in detail in Chapters
7 and 9.
Typically, only 70-80% of the volume of stirred reactors is
filled With liquid; this allows adequate headspace for disen-
gagement of droplets from the exhaust gas and to
accommodate any foam which may develop. If foaming is a
problem, a supplementary impeller called a foam breakermay
be installed as shown in Figure 13.4. Alternatively, chemical
antifoam agents are added to the broth; because antifoams
reduce the rate of oxygen transfer (see Section 9.6.3), mechan-
ical foam dispersal is generally preferred.
The aspect ratio of stirred vessels, i.e. the ratio of height to
diameter, can be varied over a wide range. The least expensive
shape to build has an aspect ratio of about 1; this shape has the
smallest surface area and therefore requires the least material to
construct for a given volume. However, when aeration is
required, the aspect ratio is usually increased. This provides for
longer contact times between the rising bubbles and liquid and
produces a greater hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the
vessel.
As shown in Figure 13.4, temperature control and heat
transfer in stirred vessels can be accomplished using internal
cooling coils. Alternative cooling equipment for bioreactors is
illustrated in Figure 8.1 (p. 165). The relative advantages and
disadvantages of different heat-exchange systems are discussed
in Section 8.1.1.
Stirred fermenters are used for free- and immobilised-I3 Reactor Engineering

enzyme reactions, and for culture of suspended and immobil-
ised cells. Care is required with particulate catalysts which may
be damaged or destroyed by the impeller at high speeds. As dis-
cussed in Section 7.14, high levels of shear can also damage
sensitive cells, particularly in plant and animal cell culture.
13.2.2
Bubble Column
Alternatives to the stirred reactor include vessels with no
mechanical agitation. In bubble-column reactors, aeration
and mixing are achieved bygas sparging; this requires less
energy than mechanical stirring. Bubble columns are applied
industrially for production of bakers' yeast, beer and vinegar,
and for treatment ofwastewater.
Bubble columns are structurally very simple. As shown in
Figure 13.5, they are generally cylindrical vessels with height
greater than twice the diameter. Other than a sparger for entry
of compressed air, bubble columns typically have no internal
structures. A height-to-diameter ratio of about 3:1 is common
in bakers' yeast production; for other applications, towers with
height-to-diameter ratios of 6:1 have been used. Perforated
horizontal plates are sometimes installed in tall bubble col-
umns to break up and redistribute coalesced bubbles.
Advantages of bubble columns include low capital cost, lack of
moving parts, and satisfactory heat- and mass-transfer perfor-
mance. As in stirred vessels, foaming can be a problem
requiring mechanical dispersal or addition of antifoam to the
medium.
Bubble-column hydrodynamics and mass-transfer charac-
teristics depend entirely on the behaviour of the bubbles
released from the sparger. Different flow regimes occur
depending on the gas flow rate, sparger design, column diame-
ter and medium properties such as viscosity. Homogeneousflow
occurs only at low gas flow rates and when bubbles leaving the
sparger are evenly distributed across the column cross-section.
In homogeneous flow, all bubbles rise with the same upward
velocity and there is no backmixing of the gas phase. Liquid
mixing in this flow regime is also limited, arising solely from
entrainment in the wakes of the bubbles. Under normal
operating conditions at higher gas velocities, large chaotic
circulatory flow cells develop and heterogeneousflow occurs as
illustrated in Figure 13.6. In this regime, bubbles and liquid
tend to rise up the centre of the column while a corresponding
downflow of liquid occurs near the walls. Liquid circulation
entrains bubbles so that some backmixing of gas occurs.
Liquid mixing time in bubble columns depends on the flow
regime. For heterogeneous flow, the following equation has
been proposed [4] for the upward liquid velocity at the centre
ofthe column for 0.1 < D< 7.5 m and 0 < u G < 0.4 m s - l :
UL= O.9( g D UG)0"33
(13.1)
where u L is linear liquid velocity, g is gravitational accelera-
tion, D is column diameter, and u G is gas superficial
velocity, u G is equal to the volumetric gas flow rate at atmos-
pheric pressure divided by the reactor cross-sectional area.
From this equation, an expression for the mixing time tm (see
Section 7.9.4) can be obtained [5]:
t m = 11 __H (gUGD_2)_0.33
D
(13.2).
where H is the height of the bubble column.
As discussed in Section 9.6.1, values for gas-liquid mass-
transfer coefficients in reactors depend largely on bubble
diameter and gas hold-up. In bubble columns containing non-
viscous liquids, these variables depend solely on the gas flow
rate. However, as exact bubble sizes and liquid circulationI3 ReactorE

where kga is the combined volumetric mass-transfer coeffi-
cient and u G is the gas superficial velocity. Eq. (13.3) is valid
for bubbles with mean diameter about 6 mm, 0.08 m < D <
11.6 m, 0.3 m < H< 21 m, and 0 < u G < 0.3 m s -1. Ifsmaller
bubbles are produced at the sparger and the medium is non-
coalescing, kLa will be larger than the value calculated using
Eq. (13.3), especially at low values of u G less than about
10 -2 m s -1 [4].

estimation of the mass-transfer coefficient is difficult. The fol-
lowing correlation has been proposed for non-viscous media

kLa = 0.32u~ .7

Airlift Reactor
As in bubble columns, mixing in airlift reactors is accom-
plished without mechanical agitation. Airlift reactors are often
chosen for culture of plant and animal cells and immobilised
catalysts because shear levels are significantly lower than in
stirred vessels.
Several types of airlift reactor are in use. Their distinguish-
ing feature compared with the bubble column is that patterns
of liquid flow are more defined owing to the physical separa-
tion of up-flowing and down-flowing streams. As shown in
Figure 13.7, gas is sparged into only part of the vessel cross-
section called the r/ser. Gas hold-up and decreased fluid
density cause liquid in the riser to move upwards. Gas
disengages at the top of the vessel leaving heavier bubble-free
liquid to recirculate through the downcomer.Liquid circulates
in airlift reactors as a result of the density difference between
riser and downcomer.
Figure 13.7 illustrates the most common airlift configura-
tions. In the internal-loop vessels of Figures 13.7(a) and
13.7(b), the riser and downcomer are separated by an internal
bafHe or draJi tube; air may be sparged into either the draft
tube or the annulus. In the external-loopor outer-loopairlift of
Figure 13.7(c), separate vertical tubes are connected by short
horizontal sections at the top and bottom. Because the riser
and downcomer are further apart in external-loop vessels, gas
disengagement is more effective than in internal-loop devices.
Fewer bubbles are carried into the downcomer, the density dif-
ference between fluids in the riser and downcomer is greater,
and circulation of liquid in the vessel is faster. Accordingly,
mixing is usually better in external-loop than internal-loop
reactors.
Airlift reactors generally provide better mixing than bubble
columns except at low liquid velocities when circulatory flow-
patterns similar to those shown in Figure 13.6 develop. The
airlift configuration confers a degree of stability to liquid flow
compared with bubble columns; therefore, higher gas flow
rates can be used without incurring operating problems such as
slug flow or "spray formation. Several empirical correlations
have been developed for liquid velocity, circulation time and13 Reactor Engineering

mixing time in airlift reactors; however there is considerable
discrepancy between the results [6]. Equations derived from
hydrodynamic models are also available [6, 7]; these are usually
relatively complex and, because liquid velocity and gas hold-up
are not independent, require iterative numerical solution.
Gas hold-up and gas-liquid mass-transfer rates in internal-
loop airlifts are similar to those in bubble columns [6].
However, in external-loop devices, near-complete gas disen-
gagement increases the liquid velocity and decreases the air
hold-up [8, 9] so that mass-transfer rates at identical gas veloc-
ities are lower than in bubble columns [6]. Therefore, by
comparison with Eq. (13.3) for bubble columns, for external-
loop airlifts:
t

kLa < 0.32 u~ "7.
(13.4)
Several other empirical mass-transfer correlations have been
developed for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in airlift
reactors [6].
Performance of airlift devices is influenced significantly by the
details of vessel construction [6, 10, 11]. For example, in
internal-loop airlifts, changing the distance between the lower
edge of the draft tube and the base of the reactor alters the
pressure drop in this region and affects liquid velocity and gas
hold-up. The depth of draft-tube submersion from the top of the
liquid also influences mixing and mass-transfer characteristics.I3 Reactor Engineering
Airlift reactors have been applied in production of single-
cell protein from methanol and gas oil; they are also used for
plant and animal cell culture and in municipal and industrial
waste treatment. Large airlift reactors with capacities of
thousands of cubic metres have been constructed. Tall
internal-loop airlifts built underground are known as deep-
shaft reactors; very high hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of
these vessels considerably improves gas-liquid mass-transfer.
The height of airlift reactors is typically about 10 times the
diameter; for deep-shaft systems the height-to-diameter ratio
may be increased up to 100.

P a c k e d Bed
Packed-bed reactors are used with immobilised or particulate
biocatalysts. The reactor consists of a tube, usually vertical,
packed with catalyst particles. Medium can be fed either at the
top or bottom of the column and forms a continuous liquid
phase between the particles. Damage due to particle attrition is
minimal in packed beds compared with stirred reactors.

1 3 . 2 . 4 Stirred and Air-Driven Reactors:
Comparison of Operating Characteristics
For low-viscosity fluids, adequate mixing and mass transfer
can be achieved in stirred tanks, bubble columns and airlift
vessels. When a large fermenter (50-500 m 3) is required for
low-viscosity culture, a bubble column is an attractive choice
because it is simple and cheap to install and operate.
Mechanically-agitated reactors are impractical at volumes
greater than about 500 m 3 as the power required to achieve
adequate mixing becomes extremely high (see Section 7.11).
If the culture has high viscosity, sufficient mixing and mass
transfer cannot be provided by air-driven reactors. Stirred ves-
sels are more suitable for viscous liquids because greater power
can be input by mechanical agitation. Nevertheless, mass-
transfer rates decline rapidly in stirred vessels at viscosities
greater than 50-100 cP [5].
Heat transfer can be an important consideration in the
choice between air-driven and stirred reactors. Mechanical
agitation generates much more heat than sparging of com-
pressed gas. When the heat of reaction is high, such as in
production of single-cell protein from methanol, removal of
frictional stirrer heat can be a problem so that air-driven reac-
tors may be preferred.
Stirred-tank and air-driven vessels account for the vast
majority ofbioreactor configurations used for aerobic culture.
However, other reactor configurations may be used in par-
ticular processes.

immobilised cells and enzymes for production ofaspartate and
fumarate, conversion of penicillin to 6-aminopenicillanic
acid, and resolution of amino acid isomers.
Mass transfer between the liquid medium and solid catalyst
is facilitated at high liquid flow rates through the bed; to
achieve this, packed beds are often operated with liquid recycle
as shown in Figure 13.8. The catalyst is prevented from leav-
ing the column by screens at the liquid exit. The particles
should be relatively incompressible and able to withstand their
own weight in the column without deforming and occluding
liquid flow. Recirculating medium must also be clean and free
of debris to avoid clogging the bed. Aeration is generally
accomplished in a separate vessel; if air is sparged directly into
the bed, bubble coalescence produces gas pockets and flow
channelling or maldistribution. Packed beds are unsuitable for
processes which produce large quantities of carbon dioxide or
other gases which can become trapped in the packing.
13.2.6
F l u i d i s e d Bed
When packed beds are operated in upflow mode with catalyst
beads of appropriate size and density, the bed expands at high
liquid flow rates due to upward motion of the particles. This is
the basis for operation offluidised-bed reactors as illustrated in
Figure 13.9. Because particles in fluidised beds are in constant
motion, channelling and clogging of the bed are avoided and
air can be introduced directly into the column. Fluidised-bed
reactors are used in waste treatment with sand or similar
material supporting mixed microbial populations. They are
also used with flocculating organisms in brewing and for
production of vinegar.I3 ReactorE

13.2.7 Trickle Bed
The trickle-bed reactor is another variation of the packed bed.
As illustrated in Figure 13.10, liquid is sprayed onto the top of
the packing and trickles down through the bed in small rivu-
lets. Air may be introduced at the base; because the liquid
phase is not continuous throughout the column, air and other
gases move with relative ease around the packing. Trickle-bed
reactors are used widely for aerobic wastewater treatment.
13.3 Practical Considerations For Bioreactor
Construction
Industrial bioreactors for sterile operation are usually designed
as steel pressure vessels capable of withstanding full vacuum up
to about 3 atm positive pressure at 150-180~ A hole is pro-
vided on large vessels to allow workers entry into the tank for
cleaning and maintenance; on smaller vessels the top is remov-
able. Flat headplates are commonly used with laboratory-scale
fermenters; for larger vessels a domed construction is less
expensive. Large fermenters are equipped with a lighted verti-
cal sight-glass for inspecting the contents of the reactor.
Nozzles for medium, antifoam, acid and alkali addition,
air-exhaust pipes, pressure gauge, and a rupture disc for

emergency pressure release, are normally located on the head-
plate. Side ports for pH, temperature and dissolved-oxygen
sensors are a minimum requirement; a steam-sterilisable
sample outlet should also be provided. The vessel must be fully
draining via a harvest nozzle located at the lowest point of the
reactor. If the vessel is mechanically agitated, either a top- or
bottom-entering stirrer is installed.
13.3.1 . Aseptic Operation
Most fermentations outside of the food and beverage industry
are carried out using pure cultures and aseptic conditions.
Keeping the reactor free of unwanted organisms is especially
important for slow-growing cultuTes which can be quickly
over-run by contamination. Fermenters must be capable of
operating aseptically for a number of days, sometimes months.
Typically, 3-5% of fermentations in an industrial plant are
lost due to failure ofsterilisation procedures. However, the fre-
quency and causes of contamination vary considerably from
process to process. For example, the nature of the product in
antibiotic fermentations affords some protection from con-
tamination; fewer than 2% of production-scale antibiotic
fermentations are lost through contamination by microorgan-
isms or phage [12]. In contrast, a contamination rate of
17% has been reported for industrial-scale production of
3-interferon from human fibroblasts cultured in 50-1itre bio-
reactors [ 13].I3 Reactor E

Industrial fermenters are designed for in situ steam sterilisa-
tion under pressure. The vessel should have a minimum
number of internal structures, ports, nozzles, connections and
other attachments to ensure that steam reaches all parts of the
equipment. For effective sterilisation, all air in the vessel and
pipe connections must be displaced by steam. The reactor
should be free of crevices and stagnant areas where liquid or
solids can accumulate; polished welded joints are used in pref-
erence to other coupling methods. Small cracks or gaps in
joints and fine fissures in welds are a haven for microbial
contaminants and are avoided in fermenter construction
whenever possible. After sterilisation, all nutrient medium and
air entering the fermenter must be sterile. As soon as flow of
steam into the fermenter is stopped, sterile air is introduced to
maintain a slight positive pressure in the vessel and discourage

entry of air-borne contaminants. Filters preventing passage of
microorganisms are fitted to exhaust-gas lines; this serves to
contain the culture inside the fermenter and insures against
contamination should there be a drop in operating pressure.
Flow of liquids to and from the fermenter is controlled
using valves. Because valves are a potential entry point for con-
caminants, their construction must be suitable for aseptic
operation. Common designs such as simple gate and globe
valves have a tendency to leak around the valve stem and accu-
mulate broth solids in the closing mechanism. Although used
in the fermentation industry, they are unsuitable ifa high level
of sterility is required. Pinch and diaphragm valves such as
those shown in Figures 13.11 and 13.12 are recommended for
fermenter construction. These designs make use of flexible
sleeves or diaphragms so that the closing mechanism is isolated
from the contents of the pipe and there are no dead spaces in
the valve structure. Rubber or neoprene capable of withstand-
ing repeated sterilisation cycles is used to fashion the valve
closure; the main drawback is that these components must be
checked regularly for wear to avoid valve failure. To minimise
costs, ball and plug valves are also used in fermenter construc-
tion.
With stirred reactors, another potential entry point for con-
tamination is where the stirrer shaft enters the vessel. The gap
between the rotating stirrer shaft and the fermenter body must
be sealed; if the fermenter is operated for long periods, wear at
the seal opens the way for air-borne contaminants. Several types
of stirrer seal have been developed to prevent contamination.
On large fermenters, mechanical seals are commonly used [ 14].

In these devices, one part of the assembly is stationary while the
other rotates on the shaft; the precision-machined surfaces of
the two components are pressed together by springs or expand-
ing bellows and cooled and lubricated with water. Mechanical
seals with running surfaces of silicon carbide paired with tung-
sten carbide are often specified for fermenter application. Stirrer
seals are especially critical if the reactor is designed with a
bottom-entering stirrer; double mechanical seals may be
installed to prevent fluid leakage. On smaller vessels, magnetic
drives can be used to couple the stirrer shaft with the motor;
with these devices, the shaft does not pierce the fermenter body.
A magnet in a housing on the outside of the fermenter is driven
by the stirrer motor; inside, another magnet is attached to the
end of the stirrer shaft and held in place by bearings. Sufficient
power can be transmitted using magnetic drives to agitate vessels
up to at least 800 litres in size [15]. However, the suitability of
magnetic drives for viscous broths, especially when high oxygen-
transfer rates are required, is limited.
13.3.2
Fermenter Inoculation and Sampling
Consideration must be given in design of fermenters for asep-
tic inoculation and sample removal. Inocula for large-scale
fermentations are transferred from smaller reactors; to prevent
contamination during this operation, both vessels are main-
tained under positive air pressure. The simplest aseptic
transfer method is to pressurise the inoculum vessel using
sterile air; culture is then effectively blown into the larger
fermenter. An example of the pipe and valve connections
required for this type of transfer is shown in Figure 13.13. The
fermenter and its piping and the inoculum tank and its piping
including valves H and I are sterilised separately before culture
is added to the inoculum tank. With valves H and I closed, the
small vessel is joined to the fermenter at connections A and B.
Because these connectors were open prior to being joined, they
must be sterilised before the inoculum tank is opened. With
valves D, H, I and C closed and A and B slightly open, steam
flows through E, F and G and bleeds slowly from A and B.
After about 20 minutes' steam sterilisation, valves E and G and
connectors A and B are closed; the route from inoculum tank
to fermenter is now sterile. Valves D and C are opened for flow
of sterile air into the fermenter to cool the line under positive
pressure. Valve F is then closed, valves H and I are opened and
sterile air is used to force the contents of the inoculum tank
into the fermenter. The line between the vessels is emptied of
most residual liquid by blowing through with sterile air.
Valves D, C, H and I are then closed to isolate both the fer-
menter and the empty inoculum tank which can now be
disconnected at A and B.
Sampling ports are fitted to fermenters to allow removal of
broth for analysis. An arrangement for sampling which pre-
serves aseptic operation is shown in Figure 13.14. Initially,
valves A and D are closed; valves B and C are open to maintain
a steam barrier between the reactor and the outside environ-
ment. Valve C is then closed, valve B partially closed and valve
D partially opened to allow steam and condensate to bleed
from the sampling port D. For sampling, A is opened briefly to
cool the pipe and carry away any condensate that would dilute
the sample; this broth is discarded. Valve B is then closed and a
sample collected through D. When sampling is complete,
valve A is closed and B opened for re-sterilisation of the sample
line; this prevents any contaminants which entered while D
was open from travelling up to the fermenter. Valve D is then
closed and valve C re-opened.
13.3.3
Materials
of Construction
Fermenters are constructed from materials that can withstand
repeated steam sterilisation and cleaning cycles. Materials con-
tacting the fermentation medium and broth should also be
non-reactive and non-absorptive. Glass is used to construct fer-
menters up to about 30 litres capacity. The advantages of glass
are that it is smooth, non-toxic, corrosion-proof and transparent
for easy inspection of the vessel contents. Because entry ports are
required for medium, inoculum, air and instruments such as pHI3 Reactor Engineering

blocking the sparger can also be a problem. Orifice spargers,
also known as perforated pipes, are constructed by making
small holes in piping which is then fashioned into a ring or
cross and placed at the base of the reactor; individual holes
must be large enough to minimise blockages. Orifice spargers
have been used to a limited extent for production of yeast and
single-cell protein and in waste treatment. Nozzle spargersare
used in many agitated fermenters from laboratory to pro-
duction scale. These spargers consist of a single open or
partially-closed pipe providing a stream of air bubbles; advan-
tages compared with other sparger designs include low
resistance to gas flow and small risk of blockage. Other sparger
designs have also been developed. In two-phase ejector-injec-
tors, gas and liquid are pumped concurrently through a nozzle
to produce tiny bubbles; in combined sparger-agitator designs
for smaller fermenters, a hollow stirrer-shaft is used for deliv-
ery of air. Irrespective of sparger design, provision should be
made for in-place cleaning of the interior of the pipe.
13.3.5
and temperature sensors, glass fermenters are usually equipped
with stainless steel headplates containing many screw fittings.
Most pilot- and large-scale fermenters are made of corro-
sion-resistant'stainless steel, although mild steel with stainless
steel cladding has also been used. Cheaper grades of stainless
steel may be used for the jacket and other surfaces isolated
from the broth. Copper and copper-containing materials must
be avoided in all parts of the fermenter contacting the culture
because of its toxic effect on cells. Interior steel surfaces are
polished to a bright 'mirror' finish to facilitate cleaning and
sterilisation of the reactor; welds on the interior of the vessel
are ground flush before polishing. Electropolishing is pre-
ferred over mechanical polishing which leaves tiny ridges and
grooves in the metal to accumulate dirt and microorganisms.
13.3.4
Sparger Design
The sparger, impeller and baffles determine the effectiveness
of mixing and oxygen mass transfer in stirred bioreactors.
Design of impellers and baffles is discussed in Section 7.9.
Three types ofsparger are commonly used in bioreactors: por-
ous, orifice and nozzle. Porous spargersof sintered metal, glass
or ceramic are used mainly in small-scale applications; gas
throughput is limited because the sparger poses a high resist-
ance to flow. Cells growing through the fine holes and
Evaporation Control
Aerobic cultures are continuously sparged with air; however,
most components of air are inert and leave directly through
the exhaust gas line. If air entering the fermenter is dry, water
is continually stripped from the medium and leaves the system
as vapour. Over a period of days, evaporative water loss can be
significant. This problem is more pronounced in air-driven
reactors because the gas flow rates required for good mixing
and mass transfer are generally higher than in stirred reactors.
To combat evaporation problems, air sparged into fer-
menters may be pre-humidified by bubbling through columns
of water outside the fermenter; humid air entering the fer-
menter has less capacity for evaporation than dry air.
Fermenters are also equipped with water-cooled condensers to
return to the broth any vapours carried by the exit gas.
Evaporation can be a particular problem when products or
substrates are more volatile than water. For example,
Acetobacter species are used to produce acetic acid from
ethanol in a highly aerobic process requiring large quantities of
air. It has been reported for stirred-tank reactors operated at air
flow rates between 0.5 and 1.0 w m (vvm means volume ofgas
per volume of liquid per minute) that from a starting alcohol
concentration of 5%, 30-50% of the substrate is lost within
48 hours due to evaporation [ 16].
13.4 Monitoring and Control of Bioreactors

dissolved-oxygen concentration, medium flow rate, stirrer
speed and sparging rate have a significant effect on the out-
come of fermentation and enzyme reactions. To provide the
desired environment, system properties must be monitored
and control action taken to rectify any deviations from the
desired values. Fermentation monitoring and control is an
active area of research aimed at improving the performance of
bioprocesses and achieving uniform and reliable fermenter
operation.
Various levels of process control exist in the fermentation
industry. Manual control is the simplest, requiring a human
operator to manipulate devices such as pumps, motors and
valves. Automatic feedback control is used to maintain param-
eters at specified values. With increasing application of
computers in the fermentation industry, there is also scope for
implementing advanced control and optimisation strategies
based on fermentation models.
13.4.1
Fermentation Monitoring
Any attempt to understand or control the state of a fermenta-
tion depends on knowledge of critical variables which affect
the process. These parameters can be grouped into three cate-
gories: physical, chemical and biological. Examples of process
variables in each group are given in Table 13.1. Many of the
physical measurements listed are well established in the fer-
mentation industry; others are currently being developed or
are the focus of research into new instrumentation.
Despite the importance of fermentation monitoring,
industrially-reliable instruments and sensors capable of rapid,
accurate and direct measurements are not available for many
process variables. For effective control of fermentations based
on measured data, the time taken to complete the measure-

ment should be compatible with the rate of change of the vari-
able being monitored. For example, in a typical fermentation,
the time scale for change in pH and dissolved-oxygen tension
is several minutes, while the time scale for change in culture
fluorescence is less than 1 second. For other variables such as
biomass concentration, an hour or more may pass before
measurable changes occur. The frequency and speed of
measurement must be consistent with these time scales.
Ideally, measurements should be made in situ and on-line, i.e.
in or near the reactor during operation, so that the result is
available for timely control action. Many important variables
such as biomass concentration and broth composition cannot
currently be measured on-line because of the lack of appropri-
ate instruments. Instead, samples must be removed from the
reactor and taken to the laboratory for off-line analysis.
Because fermentation conditions can change during labora-
tory analysis, control action based on the measurement is not
as effective. Off-line measurements are used in industrial fer-
mentations for analysis of biomass, carbohydrate, protein,
phosphate and lipid concentrations, enzyme activity and
broth rheology. Samples are usually taken manually every
4-8 h; the results are available 2-24 h later.
Examples of measurements which can be made on-line in
industry are temperature, pressure, pH, dissolved-oxygen ten-
sion, flow rate, stirrer speed, power consumption, foam level,
broth weight and gas composition. Instruments for taking
these measurements are relatively commonplace; detailed
descriptions can be found elsewhere [ 17-19]. The availability
of an on-line measurement or its use in the laboratory does not
necessarily mean it is applied in commercial-scale processing.
Owing to the cost of installation and the financial conse-
quences of instrument failure during fermentation, measure-
ment devices used in industry must meet stringent performance

criteria. These include: accuracy to within 1-2% of full scale,
reliable operation for at least 80% of the time, low mainten-
ance needs, steam sterilisability, simple and fast calibration,
and maximum drift of less than 1-2% of full scale [1].
Sterilisable pH probes have been proven reliable if properly
grounded and are used widely in industrial fermentations;
their low failure rate is assisted by replacement every four or
five fermentations. However, a variety of problems is associ-
ated in the industrial environment with electrodes for
dissolved carbon dioxide, redox potential and specific ions;
these instruments are therefore confined mostly to laboratory
applications. Drift and interference from air bubbles are well-
known limitations with dissolved-oxygen probes in industrial
fermenters; deposits and microbial fouling of the membrane
also reduce measurement reliability. Even if electrodes are
steam sterilisable, probe life can be significantly reduced by
repeated sterilisation cycles.
Development of new on-line measurements for chemical
and biological variables is a challenging area of bioprocess
engineering research. One of the areas targeted is biosensors
[20, 21]. There are many different biosensor designs; however,
in general, biosensors incorporate a biological sensing element
in close proximity or integrated with a signal transducer. As
illustrated schematically in Figure 13.15, the binding specific-
ity of particular biological molecules immobilised on the
probe is used to 'sense' or recognise target species in the fer-
mentation broth; ultimately, an electrical signal is generated
after the interaction between sensing molecules and analyte is
detected by the transducer. Biosensors which use immobilised
cells to recognise broth components are also being developed.
Biosensors with enzyme, antibody and cell sensing-elements
have been tested for a wide range of substrates and products
including glucose, sucrose, ethanol, acetic acid, ammonia,
penicillin, urea, riboflavin, cholesterol and amino acids.
However, although several biosensors are available commer-
cially, they are not used for routine monitoring of large-scale
fermentations because of intractable problems with robust-
ness, sterilisation, limited life-span and long-term stability. At
this stage, because of the sensitivity of their biological compo-
nents, biosensors appear to be more suitable for medical
diagnostics and environmental analyses than in situ bioprocess
applications. Nevertheless, biosensors may be used for rapid
analysis of broth samples removed from fermenters.
Another approach to on-line chemical and biological mea-
surements involves use of automatic sampling devices linked
to analytical equipment for high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC), image analysis, NMR, flow cytometry or
fluorometry. For these techniques to work, methods must be
available for on-line aseptic sampling and analysis without
blockage or interference from gas bubbles and cell solids.z 3 Reactor Engineering

evolution in a production-scale fermenter; in many cases, sig-
nal conditioningor smoothingmust be carried out to reduce the
noise in these data before they can be applied for process con-
trol or modelling. Most modern data acquisition and logging
systems contain facilities for signal conditioning. Unwanted
pseudo-random noise can be filtered out using analogue filter
circuits or by averaging values over successive measurements.
Alternatively, unfiltered signals can be digitised and filtering
algorithms applied using computer software. Measurement
drift cannot be corrected using electronic circuitry; instru-
ments must be periodically recalibrated during long
fermentations to avoid loss of accuracy.
Raw data are sometimes used to calculate derived variables
which characterise the performance of the fermenter. The
most common derived variables are oxygen-uptake rate, rate of
carbon dioxide evolution, the respiratory quotient RQ, and
the mass-transfer coe~cient kLa. As oxygen-uptake rate is
usually calculated from the difference between two quantities
of similar magnitude (gas inlet and outlet oxygen levels; see
Section 9.10.1), noise in this variable can be significant [24]
and affect the quality of other dependent variables such as kLa
and RQ.
13.4.3 Fault Analysis
Faults in reactor operation affect 15-20% of fermentations
[25]. Fermentation measurements can be used to detect faults;
for example, signals from a flow sensor could be used to detect
blockages in a pipe and trigger an alarm in the factory control
room. Normally however, the sensors themselves are the most
likely components to fail; rates of failure of some fermentation
instruments are listed in Table 13.2. Failure of a sensor might
Table 13.2
be detected as an unexpected change or rate of change in its
signal, or a change in the noise characteristics. Several
approaches can be used to reduce the impact of faults on large-
scale fermentations; these include comparison of current
measurements with historical values, cross-checking between
independent measurements, using multiple and back-up sen-
sors, and building hardware redundancy into computer
systems and power supplies.
13.4.4 Process Modelling
In modern approaches to fermentation control, a reasonably
accurate mathematical model of the reaction and reactor
environment is required. Using process models, we can
progress beyond environmental control ofbioreactors into the
realm of direct biological control. Development of fermenta-
tion models is aided by information from measurements taken
during process operation.
Models are mathematical relationships between variables.
Traditionally, models are based on a combination of'theoreti-
cal' relationships which provide the structure of the model,
and experimental observations which provide the numerical
values of coefficients. For biological processes, specifying the
model structure can be difficult because of the complexity of
cellular processes and the large number of environmental fac-
tors which affect cell culture. Usually, bioprocess models are
much-simplified approximate representations deduced from
observation rather than from theoretical laws of science. As an
example, a frequently-used mathematical model for batch fer-
mentation consists of the Monod equation for growth and an
expression for rate of substrate consumption as a function of
biomass concentration:

This model represents a combination of Eqs (11.52), (11.60)
and (11.72). The form of the equations was determined from
experimental observation of a large number of different cul-
ture systems. In principle, once values of the parameters/~max'
KS' YXS and m s have been determined, we can use the model
to estimate cell concentration x and substrate concentration s
as a function of time. A common problem with fermentation
models is that the model parameters can be difficult to
measure or change with time.
We have already encountered several model equations in
this book; examples include the kinetic, yield and mainten-
ance relationships introduced in Chapter 11 and the
stoichiometric equations of Chapter 4 relating masses of sub-
strates, biomass and products during reaction. Other models
were derived in Chapter 12 for heterogeneous reactions;
dependence of culture parameters such as cell concentration
on physical, conditions in the bioreactor are represented in
simple form by the equations of Sections 8.6.1 and 9.5.2.
Process models vary in form but have the unifying feature that
they predict outputs from a set of inputs. When models are
used for fermentation control, they are usually based on mass-
and energy-balance equations for the system.
Development of a comprehensive model covering all key
aspects of a particular bioprocess and able to predict the effects
of a wide range of culture variables is a demanding exercise.
Accurate models applicable to a range of process conditions
are rare. AS many aspects of fermentation are poorly under-
stood, it difficult to devise mathematical models covering
these areas. For example, the response of cells to spatial varia-
tions in dissolved-oxygen and substrate levels in fermenters, or
the effect of impeller design on microbial growth and produc-
tivity, is not generally incorporated into models because the
subject has been inadequately studied. Evidence that all
important fermentation variables have not yet been identified
is the significant batch-to-batch variation that occurs in the
fermentation industry.
13.4.5 State Estimation
As described in Section 13.4.1, it is not possible to measure
on-line all the key variables or states of a fermentation process.
Often, considerable delays are involved in off-line measure-
ment of important variables such as biomass, substrate and
product concentrations. Such delays make effective control of
the reactor difficult if control action is dependent on the value
of these parameters, but must be undertaken more quickly
than off-line analysis allows. One approach to this problem is
to use available on-line measurements in conjunction with
mathematical models of the process to estimate unknown
variables. The computer programs and numerical procedures
developed to achieve this are called software sensors, estimators
or observers. The Kalman filter is a well-known type of observer
applicable to linear process equations; non-linear systems can
be treated using the extendedKalmanfllter [26]. The success of
Kalman filters and other observers depends largely on the
accuracy and robustness of the process model used.
Several techniques for state estimation are available. As a
simple example, on-line measurements of carbon dioxide in
fermenter off-gas can be applied with an appropriate process
model to estimate biomass concentration during penicillin fer-
mentation [27]. As shown in Figure 13.17, the results were
satisfactory for 100-m 3 fed-batch fermentations over a period
of more than 8 days. Direct state estimation can achieve rea-
sonable results as long as the process model remains valid and
the estimator is able to reduce measurement noise. However, if

major fluctuations occur in operating conditions or if cell
properties and model parameters change with time, the model
may become inadequate and estimation accuracy will decline.
Adaptive estimators are used to adjust faulty model parameters
as the fermentation proceeds to alleviate problems caused by
error in the equations. Off-line measurements can also be
incorporated into the estimation procedure as they become
available to improve the accuracy and reliability of prediction.
Another technique involves 'generic' software sensors which
use generally-structured models rather than model equations
specific to the process of interest. Process characteristics are
then 'learnt' or incorporated into the model structure as
information becomes available from on- and off-line
measurements. The primary advantage of generic sensors is
that the software-development time is significantly reduced
[28].
Mass-balancing techniques are another approach to state
estimation. As described in Chapter 4, biomass can be estimat-
ed from stoichiometry and other process measurements using
elemental balances. This method is suitable for fermentation of
defined media, but is difficult to apply w i ~ complex medium
ingredients such as molasses, casein hydrolysate, soybean meal
and corn steep liquor which have undefined elemental com-
position. Another disadvantage is that the accuracy of biomass
estimation often depends on measurement of substrate or
product concentration which must be done off-line.

Feedback Control
Let us assume we wish to maintain the pH in a bioreactor at a
constant value against a variety of disturbances, for example,
PROCESS

from metabolic activity. One of the simplest control schemes
is a conventional feedback control loop, the basic elements of
which are shown in Figure 13.18. A measurement device
senses the value of the pH and sends the signal to a controller.
At the controller, the measured value is compared with the
desired value known as the set point. The deviation between
measured and desired values is the error, which is used by the
controller to determine what action must be taken to correct
the process. The controller may be a person who monitors the
process measurements and decides what to do; more often the
controller is an automatic electronic, pneumatic or computer
device. The controller produces a signal which is transmitted
to the actuator, which executes the control action. In a typical
system for pH control, an electrode would serve as the meas-
urement device and a pump connected to a reservoir of acid or
alkali as the actuator. Simple on-offcontrol is generally suffi-
cient for pH; if the measured pH falls below the set point, the
controller switches on the pump which adds alkali to the fer-
menter. When enough alkali is added and the pH returned to
the set value, the pump is switched off. Small deviations from
the set point are usually tolerated in on-off control to avoid
rapid switching and problems due to measurement delay.
On-off control is used when the actuator is an on-off
device, such as a single-speed pump. If function of the actuator
coven a continuous range, such as a variable-speed pump for
supply of cooling water or a valve determining the rate of air
flow, it is common to use proportional-integral-derivative or
PID controL With PID control, the control action is deter-
mined in proportion to the error, the integral of the error and
the derivative of the error with respect to time. The relative
weightings given to these functions determine the response of13 Reactor Engineering
the controller and the overall 'strength' of the control action.
PID control is used to determine, for example, whether the
pump speed for cooling water in the coils of a fermenter
should be increased by a small or large amount when a certain
increase in reactor temperature is detected above the set point.
Proper adjustment of PID controllers usually provides excel-
lent regulation of the measured variable. However, poorly
tuned controllers can destabilise a process and cause continu-
ous or accentuated fluctuations in culture conditions.
Considerations for adjusting PID controllers are covered in
texts on process control, for example [29].
Close fermentation control requires simultaneous moni-
toring and adjustment of many parameters. Instead of
individual controllers for each function, it is becoming com-
monplace to use a single computer or microprocessor for
several feedback control loops. The computer logs measure-
ments from a range of sensors in a time sequence and generates
electronic signals which may be used directly or indirectly to
drive various actuators. Application of computers requires
digitisation of signals from the sensor; after digital-to-analogue
conversion of the output, the computer or microprocessor can
provide the same PID functions as a conventional analogue
controller. If computers are used to drive the actuator devices,
the system is said to be under directdigital control(DDC).
13.4.7
Indirect Metabolic Control
Maintaining particular values of temperature or pH is a rather
indirect approach to bioreactor control; the wider objective is
to optimise performance of the catalyst and maximise produc-
tion of the desired product. Certain derived variables such as
the oxygen-uptake rate and respiratory quotient can be calcu-
lated from on-line fermentation measurements; these variables
reflect to some extent the biological state of the culture. It can
be advantageous to base control actions on deviation of these
metabolic variables from desired values rather than on envi-
ronmental conditions.
Indirect metabolic control is often used in fed-batch cul-
ture of bakers' yeast. Due to the Crabtree effect, yeast
metabolism can switch from respiratory to fermentative mode
depending on prevailing glucose and dissolved-oxygen con-
centrations. Maximum biomass yield from substrate is
achieved at relatively low glucose concentrations in the pres-
ence of adequate oxygen; fermentative metabolism occurs if
the glucose concentration rises above a certain level even
though oxygen may be present. Fermentative metabolism
should be avoided for biomass production because the yield of
cells is reduced as ethanol and carbon dioxide are formed as
end-products. The respiratory quotient RQ is a convenient
351
indicator of metabolic state in this process; RQ values above
about 1 indicate ethanol formation. In industrial bakers' yeast
production, the feed rate of glucose to the culture is controlled
to maintain RQvalues within the desired range.
13.4.8
Programmed
Control
Because of the inherent time-varying character of batch and
fed-batch fermentations, maintaining a constant environment
or constant values of metabolic variables is not always the opti-
mal control strategy. Depending on the process, changes in
variables such as pH and temperature at critical times can
improve production rate and yield. Varying the rate of the feed
is important in fed-batch bakers' yeast fermentations to mini-
mise the Crabtree effect and maximise biomass production.
Feed rate is also manipulated in E. colifermentations to reduce
by-product synthesis. In secondary-metabolite fermentations,
specific growth rate should be high at the start of the culture
but, at high cell densities, different conditions are required
to slow growth and stimulate product formation. Similar
strategies are needed to optimise protein synthesis from
recombinant organisms. Expression of recombinant product
is usually avoided at the start of the culture because cell growth
is adversely affected; however, later in the batch an inducer is
added to switch on protein synthesis.
For many bioprocesses, a particular time sequence of pH,
temperature, dissolved-oxygen tension, feed rate and other
variables is required to develop the culture in such a way that
productivity is maximised. A control strategy that can accom-
modate wide-ranging changes in fermentation variables is
programmed contro~ also known as batchfermenter scheduling.
In programmed control, the control policy consists of a sched-
ule of control functions to be implemented at various times
during the process. This type of control requires a detailed
understanding of the requirements of the process at various
stages and a reasonably complete and accurate mathematical
model of the system.

Bioprocess Control
Several different approaches to bioprocess control have been
described in the preceding sections. However, fermentation
systems are by nature multivariable with non-linear and time-
varying properties, and conventional control strategies may
not be totally satisfactory. In the industrial environment, addi-
tional problems are caused by unexpected disturbances which
affect process operation. Most bioprocesses cannot be
described exactly by a mathematical model; it is also difficulti3 Reactor Engineering
,,,

to identify beforehand the optimum values of metabolic or
environmental parameters and controller response functions.
The flexibility of computer software is a significant advantage
in complex situations; researchers continue to make progress
in developing optimal, adaptive and self-tuning algorithms for
bioprocess control. However, although these techniques offer
much for improving process performance, the usual mathe-
matical approach may not be the best way to solve bioprocess
control problems.
A relatively recent development in control engineering is
application of artificial intelligence techniques, especially
knowledge-based expert systems. The term 'expert system'
usually refers to computer software that processes linguistically-
formulated 'knowledge' about a particular subject; this
knowledge is represented by simple rules. The most important
step in building a useful expert system is extraction of heuristic
or subjective rules of thumb from experimental data and
human experts. Use can be made of the ever-increasing quan-
tity of measured fermentation data from industrial processes
to synthesise the wide range of rules required for expert
systems. The knowledge available is encoded using a computer
as IF/THEN type rules, e.g. IF the cell density is high, THEN
dilution with sterile water is recommended, or IF the
dissolved-oxygen concentration increases quickly AND the rate
of carbon dioxide evolution decreases quickly AND the sugar
concentration drops AND the pH increases, THEN broth har-
vest is advised. Information about the progress of highly
productive fermentations is also stored in the knowledge base.
As measured data become available from fermentations in
progress, pattern recognition techniques are applied to assess
the results and, in conjunction with the knowledge base and its
rules, handle a variety of operating problems or disturbances.
The expert system can also 'learn' new information about pro-
cess behaviour by upgrading its knowledge base. To maximise
the potential of expert systems for intelligent supervisory con-
trol of fermentation processes, large and representative data
bases of microbiological information and engineering knowl-
edge must be established for use in rule formulation and
interpretation of process phenomena. Expert systems can also
be used for fault diagnosis, estimating unmeasurable fer-
mentation properties, reconciling contradictory data and
computer-aided modelling of metabolism [30-33].
Another area of artificial intelligence with applications in
fermentation control is the theory of neural networks. Neural
networks are particularly suited for extracting useful informa-
tion from complex and uncertain data such as fermentation
measurements, and for formulating generalisations from previ-
ous experience. They offer the ability to learn complex,
non-linear relationships between variables and may therefore
be useful in development of process models and for estimating
unknown fermentation parameters. Neural network technolo-
gy is based on an analogy with the brain in that information is
stored in the form of connected computational elements or
weights (synapses) between artificial neurons. The most com-
monly-used neural structure is the feed-forward network in
which neurons are arranged in layers; incoming signals at the
input layer are fed forward through the network connections to
the output layer. The topology of the network provides it with
powerful data processing capabilities. To solve a problem, a
network structure is chosen and examples of the knowledge to
be acquired are shown to the network which adjusts the synap-
tic strength of its neural connections so that, in effect, the
knowledge is integrated within the structure. When the real
data set is presented to the system, the network is able to predict
outcomes based on the learning set. For example, information
about feed flow rate and substrate and biomass concentrations
as a function of time can be used to develop a neural network
for analysis of transient behaviour in continuous fermentation
which is able to predict future changes in substrate and cell con-
centrations [34-36]. Although a considerable amount of
research remains to be done in this area, neural networks are a
promising tool for modelling, estimating and predicting fer-
mentation characteristics.
13.5 Ideal Reactor Operation
So far in this chapter we have considered the configuration of
bioreactors and aspects of their construction and control.
Another important factor affecting reactor performance is
mode of operation. There are three principal modes of bio-
reactor operation: batch, fed-batch and continuous. Choice of
operating strategy has a significant effect on substrate
conversion, product concentration, susceptibility to contami-
nation and process reliability.
Characteristics such as final substrate, product and biomass
concentrations and the time required for conversion can be
determined for different reactor operating schemes using mass
balances. For a general reaction system, we can relate rates of
change of component masses in the system to the rate of reac-
tion using Eq. (6.5):
dM
dt
(6.5)
where Mis mass of component A in the vessel, t is time, A7ri is
the mass flow rate of A entering the reactor, M ois the mass flow
rate of A leaving, R G is the mass rate ofgeneration of A by reac-
tion, and R C is the mass rate of consumption of A by reaction.
In this section we consider application of Eq. (6.5) to batch,353

fed-batch and continuous reactors for enzyme conversion and
fermentation.

13.5.1 Batch Operation of a Mixed Reactor
J
Batch processes operate in closed systems; substrate is added at
the beginning of the process and products removed only at the
end. Aerobic reactions are not batch operations in the strictest
sense; the low solubility of oxygen in aqueous media means
that it must be supplied continuously while carbon dioxide
and other off-gases are removed. However, reactors with
neither input nor output of liquid are classified as batch. If
there are no leaks or evaporation from the vessel, the liquid
volume in batch reactors can be considered constant.
Most commercial bioreactors are mixed vessels operated in
batch. The classic mixed reactor is the stirred tank; however
mixed reactors can also be of bubble column, airlift or other
configuration as long as concentrations of substrate, product
and catalyst inside the vessel are uniform. The cost of running
a batch reactor depends on the time taken to achieve the
desired product concentration or level ofsubstrate conversion;
operating costs are reduced if the reaction is completed quick-
ly. It is therefore useful to be able to predict the time required
for batch reactions.
13.5.1.1 Enzyme reaction
Let us apply Eq. (6.5) to the limiting substrate in a batch
enzyme reactor such as that shown in Figure 13.19./f/i = /Qo
- 0 because there is no substrate flow into or out of the vessel;
mass of substrate in the reactor, M, is equal to the substrate
concentration s multiplied by the liquid volume V. As sub-
strate is not generated in the reaction, R G - 0. Rate ofsubstrate
consumption R e is equal to the volumetric rate of reaction v
multiplied by V, v is given by Eq. (11.31). Therefore, the mass
balance from Eq. (6.5) is:
d(sV)
- Vmax s

Integration of this differential equation provides an expression
for batch reaction time. Assuming Vmax and K m are constant
during the reaction, separating variables:

substrate conversion (%)
At high substrate conversions, the time required to achieve an incremental increase in conversion is greater than at low conver-
sions. Accordingly, "the benefit gained from conversions greater than 80-90% must be weighed against the significantly greater
reaction time and reactor operating costs involved.13 Reactor Engineering
355
As discussed in Section 11.5, enzymes are subject to deactiva-
tion. Thus, the concentration of active enzyme inthe reactor,
and therefore the value of Vmax, may change during reaction.
When deactivation is significant, variation of Vmax with time
can be expressed using Eq. (11.44) so that Eq. (13.8) becomes:

achieve 90% substrate conversion.

Eq. (13.14) allows evaluation of tb; however, because 0T is a
function of s, integration is not straightforward.
Similar analysis can be applied to fermentation processes to
evaluate reaction times. Let us perform a mass balance on cells

Because/~ in batch culture remains approximately constant and
equal to/%ax for most of the growth period (see Section 11.7.3),
if k cl likewise remains constant, we can integrate Eq (13.16)
directly to find the relationship between batch time and cell
concentration. Using the initial condition that x= x 0 at t= 0:

conversion and product concentration using expressions for
rates of substrate uptake and product formation derived in

Let us apply Eq. (6.5) to the growth-limiting substrate in a

flow into or out of the reactor; the mass of substrate in the reac-
tor, M, is equal to s Vwhere s is substrate concentration and Vis
liquid volume. Substrate is not generated; therefore R G = 0. R C
is equal to r s V where r s is the volumetric rate of substrate
uptake. As discussed in Section 11.10, the expression for r s
depends on whether extracellular product is formed by the cul-
ture and the relationship between product synthesis and energy
generation in the cell. If product is formed but not directly
coupled with energy metabolism, r s is given by Eq. (11.76) and:

Zymomonas mobilis is used to convert glucose to ethanol in a batch fermenter under anaerobic conditions. The yield ofbiomass
from substrate is 0.06 g g- 1; YPXis 7.7 g g- 1. The maintenance coefficient is 2.2 g g- 1 h - 1; the specific rate of product forma-

Fed-Batch Operation
Reactor
of a Mixed
In fed-batch operation, intermittent or continuous feeding of
nutrients is used to supplement the reactor contents and pro-
vide control over the substrate concentration. By starting with
a relatively dilute solution ofsubstrate and adding more nutri-
ents as the conversion proceeds, high growth rates are avoided.
This is important, for example, in cultures where the oxygen
demand during fast growth is too high for the mass-transfer
capabilities of the reactor. Alternatively, high substrate con-
centrations may be inhibitory or switch on undesirable
metabolic pathways. Fed-batch culture is used extensively in
production of bakers' yeast to overcome catabolite repression
and control oxygen demand; it is also used routinely for peni-
cillin production. Space must be allowed in fed-batch reactors
for addition of flesh medium; in some cases a portion of the
broth is removed before injection of additional material. The
flow rate and timing of the feed are often determined by
monitoring parameters such as dissolved-oxygen level or
exhaust gas composition. As enzyme reactions are rarely car-
ried out as fed-batch operations, we will consider fed-batch
reactors for fermentation only.
The flowsheet for a well-mixed fed-batch fermenter is
shown in Figure 13.22. The volumetric flow rate of entering
feed is F; the concentrations ofbiomass, growth-limiting sub-
strate and product in this stream are xi, si and Pi' respectively.
We will assume F is constant. Owing to input of the feed, the
liquid volume V is not constant. Equations for fed-batch cul-
ture are derived by carrying out unsteady-state mass balances.
The unsteady-state mass-balance equation for total mass in
a flow reactor was derived in Chapter 6:

the reactor, F i and Fo are input and output mass flow rates, and
Pi and Po are densities of input and output streams, respective-
ly. For the fed-batch reactor of Figure 13.22, Fo - 0 and
F i - F. With dilute solutions such as those often used in bio-
processing, we can assume p is constant and that Pi = P; density
can then be taken outside of the differential and cancelled
through the equation. Therefore, Eq. (6.6) for fed-batch fer-
mentation is:

Let us define the dilution rate Dwith dimensions T - 1:

In fed-batch systems V increases with time; therefore, if F is

A similar mass balance based on Eq. (6.5) can be performed for
cells. In fed-batch operation M o = 0; M i is equal to the feed
flow rate F multiplied by the cell concentration x i in the feed.
As in Section 13.5.1.2, mass of cells in the reactor, M, is equal
to xVwhere x is cell concentration and Vis liquid volume, rate
of biomass generation R G is equal to t, x V where/u is the

Because Vin fed-batch culture is a function of time, it cannot

Let us now apply Eq. (6.5) to the limiting substrate in our fed-

tors. Because D is a function of time, integration of these equa-
tions is more complicated than for batch reactors. However,
we can derive analytical expressions for fed-batch
culture if we simplify Eqs (13.41) and (13.43). Here, we will
examine the situation where the reactor is operated first in
batch until a high cell density is achieved and the substrate
virtually exhausted. When this condition is reached, fed-batch
operation is started with medium flow rate F. As a result, cell
concentration x is maintained high and approximately con-
stant so that dX/dt = O. From Eq. (13.41), if dX/dt ~. O, ~t = D.
Therefore, substituting/u --- D into the Monod expression of

Rearrangement of Eq. (13.44) gives an expression for substrate

(13.45)
Let us assume that the culture does not produce product, or, if
there is product formation, that it is directly linked with
energy generation. If maintenance requirements can also be
neglected, Eq. (13.43) can be simplified to:
ds
/zx
-
Even though cell concentration remains virtually unchanged
with dX/dt= O, because the liquid volume increases with time in
fed-batch reactors, the total mass of cells also increases.
Consider the rate of increase of total biomass in the reactor
dX/dt, where Xis equal to xV. Using the results of Eqs (13.34)
and (13.47) with dX/dt= 0:

At high cell density in the reactor, virtually all substrate enter-
ing the vessel is consumed immediately; therefore, s << si and
as~at = 0. Applying these relationships with/u = D to Eq.
(13.46), we obtain:
X-~ YxsSi .
(13.47)
For product synthesis directly coupled with energy metab-
olism, Eq. (13.47) allows us to derive an approximate
expression for product concentration in fed-batch reactors.
Assuming the feed does not contain product:
P = YPs Si"
(13.48)
X - - Xo + ( Yxs si F ) tfb
(13.50)
where tfb is the fed-batch time after commencement of feed-
ing. Eq. (13.50) indicates that, for Yxs, si and Fconstant, total
biomass in fed-batch fermenters increases as a linear function
of time.
Under conditions of high biomass density and almost com-
plete depletion of substrate, a quasi-steady-state condition
prev.ails in fed-batch reactors where dX/dt = O, dS/dt = 0 and
dP/dt= O. At quasi-steady state, Eqs (13.47) and (13.45) can be
used to calculate biomass and substrate concentrations in reac-
tors where cell death and maintenance requirements are
negligible and product is either absent or directly coupled with
energy metabolism. Eq. (13.48) allows calculation of product
concentration for metabolites directly coupled with energy
generation in the cell. At quasi-steady state, the specific
growth rate/~ and dilution rate ~/v are approximately equal;
therefore as Vincreases, the growth rate decreases. When fed-
batch operation is used for production of biomass such as
bakers' yeast, it is useful to be able to predict the total mass of
cells in the reactor as a function of time. An expression for total
biomass is given by Eq. (13.50). Note that under quasi-steady-
state conditions, x, s andp are almost constant, but/~,, V, D and
X are changing. Further details of fed-batch operation are
given by Pirt [37].

the dilution rate is therefore constant and steady state is
achieved by concentrations in the chemostat adjusting them-
selves to the feed rate. In a turbidostat, the liquid volume is
kept constant by setting the outlet flow rate equal to the inlet
flow rate; however, the inlet flow rate is adjusted to keep the
biomass concentration constant. Thus, in a turbidostat the
dilution rate adjusts to its steady-state value corresponding to
the set biomass concentration. Turbidostats require more
complex monitoring and control systems than chemostats and
are not used in large scale. Accordingly, we will concentrate
here on chemostat operation.
Characteristic operating parameters for continuous reac-
tors are the dilution rate D and the average residence time r.
These parameters are related as follows:
T -
1V
DF
(13.51)
where D is defined by Eq. (13.39). In continuous reactor oper-
ation, the amount of material that can be processed over a
given period of time is represented by the flow rate, F.
Therefore, for a given throughput, the reactor size V and
associated capital and operating costs are minimised when r is
made as small as possible. Continuous reactor theory allows us
to determine relationships between ~" (or D) and steady-state
substrate, product and cell concentrations in the reactor. This
theory is based on steady-state mass balances derived from Eq.
(6.5).
reactor is shown in Figure 13.23. If the vessel is well mixed, t h e
product stream has the same composition as the liquid in t h e
reactor (see Section 6.4). Therefore, when continuous reactors
are used with freely-suspended cells or enzymes, catalyst is
continuously withdrawn from the vessel in the product
stream. For enzymes this is a serious shortcoming as catalyst is
not produced by the reaction; in cell culture, growth supplies
additional cells to replace those removed. Continuous reactors
are used with free enzymes only if the enzyme is inexpensive
and can be added continuously to maintain the catalyst con-
centration. With more costly enzymes, continuous operation
may be feasible if the enzyme is immobilised and retained
inside the vessel. Well-mixed continuous reactors are often
referred to using the abbreviation CSTR, meaning continuous
stirred-tank reactor. The term CSTF is also sometimes used to
denote continuous stirred_tank fermenter.
Different steady-state operating strategies are available for
continuous fermenters. In a chemostat the liquid volume is
kept constant by setting the inlet and outlet flow rates equal;
13.5.4.1 Enzyme reaction
Let us apply Eq. (6.5) to the limiting substrate in a continuous
enzyme reactor operated at steady state. The mass flow rate of
substrate entering the reactor M i is equal to Fsi; if4o, the mass
flow rate of substrate leaving, is F s. As substrate is not gener-
ated by the reactor, R G = 0. Rate ofsubstrate consumption R e
is equal to the volumetric rate of reaction v multiplied by ~, v
is given by Eq. (11.31). The left-hand side of Eq. (6.5) is zero
because the system is at steady state. Therefore, the steady-
state substrate mass-balance equation for continuous enzyme
reaction is:
Fsi-Fs-

K+s
V=O
(13.52)
where Vmax is the maximum rate of reaction and K m is the
Michaelis constant. For reactions with free enzyme, we assume
that enzyme lost in the product stream is replaced continuously363

so that Vmax remains constant and steady state is achieved.
Dividing through by Vand applying the definition of dilution
rate from Eq. (13.39) gives:
For reactions with immobilised enzymes, Eq. (13.53) must
be modified to account for mass-transfer effects:
D (s i - s) =
Km+ s
VmaxS
D(s i -

s) =
(13.54)
(13.53)
If Vmax, K m and "r are known, Eq. (13.53) can be used directly
to calculate the dilution rate required to achieve a particular
level of substrate conversion. Steady-state product concentra-
tion can then be evaluated from stoichiometry.

reaction in a CSTR
Mushroom tyrosinase is immobilised in 2-mm spherical beads for conversion of tyrosine to D O P A in a continuous, well-mixed
bubble column. The Michaelis constant for the immobilised enzyme is 2 gmol m -3. A solution containing 15 gmol m -3
tyrosine is fed into the reactor; because of the high cost of the substrate, the desired conversion is 99%. The reactor is loaded
with beads at a density of 0.25 m 3 m-3; all enzyme is retained within the reactor. The intrinsic Vmax for the immobilised
enzyme is 1.5 x 10 -2 gmol s-1 per m 3 beads. The effective diffusivity of tyrosine in the beads is 7 x 10-10 m 2 s-1; external
mass-transfer effects are negligible. Immobilisation stabilises the enzyme so that deactivation is minimal over the operating
period. Determine the reactor volume needed to treat 18 m 3 tyrosine solution per day.

13.5.4.2 Cell culture
Let us consider the reactor of Figure 13.23 operated as a con-
tinuous fermenter and apply Eq. (6.5) for steady-state mass
balances on biomass, substrate and product.
For biomass, AT/i in Eq. (6.5).. is the mass flow rate of cells
entering the reactor; M i = F x i. M o is the mass flow rate of cells
leaving: ATl0 = Fx. The other terms in Eq. (6.5) are the same as
in Section 13.5.1.2; R G -/~ xVwhere/u is the specific growth
rate and Vthe reactor liquid volume; R e = k d xVwhere k d is
the specific death constant. At steady state, the left-hand side
of Eq. (6.5) is zero. Therefore, the steady-state mass-balance
equation for biomass is:
F x i - F x + l ~ x V - k d x V = O.
(13.55)
Usually, the feed stream in continuous culture is sterile so that
x i - 0. If in addition the rate of cell death is negligible com-
pared with growth, k d <</,and Eq. (13.55) becomes:
true product yield from substrate and m s is the maintenance
coefficient. In Eq. (13.59) we can divide through by V, sub-
stitute the definition of dilution rate from Eq. (13.39) and
replace ju with D according to Eq. (13.57). Rearrangement

(13.61) becomes:

/u=D.
(13.57)
As in the derivation of Eq. (13.45), applying Eq. (13.57) to the
Monod expression of Eq. (11.60) gives an equation for the
steady-state concentration of limiting substrate in the reactor:
Substituting for s from Eq. (13.58) we obtain an expression for

Eq. (13.63) is valid at steady state in the absence of mainten-

We can also apply Eq. (6.5) for a steady-state mass balance
on fermentation product. In this case, M i = FPi and AT/o= Fp.
R G is given by Eq. (13.28); R e - 0. Therefore, Eq. (6.5)

whereby x reduces to zero is known as washout;, washout of
cells occurs when the rate of cell removal in the reactor outlet
stream is greater than the rate of generation by growth. For
systems with negligible maintenance requirements and either
energy-associated or zero product formation, the critical dilu-
tion rate Dcrit at which the steady-state biomass concentration
just becomes zero can be estimated by substituting x - 0 into
Eq. (13.63) and solving for D:

Dilution rate, D (h -3)

For most cell cultures K s << si; therefore Dcrit =/*max" To
avoid washout of cells from the chemostat, the operating dilu-
tion rate must always be less than D crir Near washout the
system is very sensitive to small changes in Dwhich cause rela-
tively large shifts in x and s.
The rate ofbiomass production in a CSTR is equal to the
rate at which cells leave the reactor: Fx. The volumetric pro-

xin Eq. (13.65) can be evaluated from Eq. (13.60), (13.61) or
(13.62). The nature of qp depends on the type of product
formed (see Section 11.9).
Eq. (13.58) is an explicit expression for steady-state sub-
strate concentration in a chemostat. The steady-state biomass
concentration x can be evaluated from Eq. (13.60), ( 13.61 ) or
(13.62); the choice of expression for biomass depends on the
relative significance of maintenance metabolism and the type
of product, if any, produced. If qp is known, product concen-
tration in the reactor can be evaluated from Eq. (13.65). In the
simplest case when products are either absent or directly
linked to energy generation and maintenance effects can be
neglected, the chemostat is represented by Eqs (13.58) and
(13.63). The form of these equations is shown in Figure
13.24. At low feed rates, i.e. D --> 0, nearly all the substrate is
consumed at steady state so that, from Eq. (13.62), x - s i Yxs"

Rate ofbiomass output reaches a sharp maximum at the opti-

Dopt the slope dQx/dO -- 0. Differentiating Eq. (13.69) with
respect to D and equating to zero provides an expression for

Operation of a chemostat at Dopt gives the maximum rate of
biomass production from the reactor. However, because Dopt
is usually very close to Dcrit, it may not be practical to operate
at Do_c Small variations of dilution rate in this region can
cause ~'arge fluctuations in x and s and, unless the dilution rate
is controlled very precisely, washout may occur.
Excellent agreement between chemostat theory and experi-
mental results has been found for many culture systems. When
deviations occur, they are due primarily to imperfect operation of
the reactor. For example, if the vessel is not well mixed, some
liquid will have higher residence time in the reactor than the rest
and concentrations will not be uniform; under these conditions
the equations derived in the section do not hold. Similarly, if cells
adhere to glass or metal surfaces in the reactor and produce wall
growth, biomass will be retained in the vessel and washout will
not occur even at high dilution rates. Other deviations occur if
inadequate time is allowed for the system to reach steady state.

(a) For 90% substrate conversion, s = ( 0 . 1 si) -- 2 kg m -3. From Eq. (13.58):

(b) Assuming maintenance requirements and product formation are negligible, from Eq. (13.69):

Consider the continuous stirred-tank immobilised-cell fer-

cells are kept suspended and well mixed by the stirrer. The
concentration of immobilised cells per unit volume of liquid
in the reactor is Xim. Let us assume that Xim is constant; this is
achieved if all particles are retained in the vessel and all cells
produced by immobilised-cell growth are released into the
medium. The concentration of suspended cells is x s. We will
assume that the intrinsic specific growth rates of suspended
and immobilised cells are the same and equal to F. Suspended
cells are removed from the reactor in the product stream;
immobilised cells are retained inside the vessel. For simplicity,
let us assume that cell death and maintenance requirements
are negligible, the reactor feed is sterile, and any product syn-
thesis is directly coupled with energy metabolism.
The system shown in Figure 13.26 reaches steady state.

chemostat with suspended cells only, i.e. Xim -- 0, at steady
state D - / ~ and the maximum operating dilution rate Dcrit is
limited by the maximum specific growth rate of the cells.
From Eq. (13.73), for any Xim > 0, D at steady state in the
immobilised-cell reactor is greater than/~. Accordingly, dilu-
tion rate is no longer limited by the maximum growth rate
and, as shown in Figure 13.27, immobilised-cell chemostats
can be operated at D considerably greater than Dcrit without
washout. At a given dilution rate, presence of immobilised
cells also improves substrate conversion and reduces the
amount of substrate lost in the product stream. However,
reaction rates with immobilised cells can be reduced signific-
antly by the effects of mass transfer in and around the
particles. As illustrated in Figure 13.27, at the same concen-
tration ofimmobilised cells, substrate conversion a t r/T = 1.0
is greater than at lower values of 77T when mass-transfer limi-
tations are significant.
13.5.6 Chemostat Cascade
The joining together of two or more CSTRs in series produces
a multi-stage process in which conditions such as pH, temper-
ature and medium composition can be varied in each reactor.
This is advantageous if reactor conditions required for growth
are different from those for product synthesis, e.g. in produc-
tion of recombinant proteins and many metabolites not
directly linked with energy metabolism. One way of operating
a two-stage chemostat cascade is shown in Figure 13.28; in this
process the product stream from the first reactor feeds directly
into the second. Substrate leaving the first reactor at concen-
tration sI is converted in the second tank so that s2 < sI and
P2 > Pl" In some applications, the second CSTR is supple-
mented with fresh medium containing nutrients, inducers or
inhibitors for optimal product formation.
Design equations for cell and enzyme CSTR cascades can be
derived as a simple extension of the theory developed in
Section 13.5.4; the same mass-balance principles are applied

and steady state is assumed at each reactor stage. Details can be
found in other references [5, 37, 38]. In fermenter cascades,
cells entering the second and subsequent vessels may go
through periods of unbalanced growth as they adapt to the
new environmental conditions in each reactor. Therefore, use
of simple unstructured metabolic models such as those out-
lined in this text does not always give accurate results.
Nevertheless, it can be shown that the total reactor residence
time required to achieve a given degree ofsubstrate conversion
is significantly smaller with two CSTRs in series than if only
one CSTR were used. In other words, the total reactor volume
required is reduced with two smaller tanks in series than with a
single large tank. Usually however, only two to four reactors in
series are justified as the benefits associated with adding success-
ive stages diminish significantly [39].
13.5.7 Chemostat With Cell Recycle
Cell concentration in a single chemostat can be increased by
recycling biomass from the product stream back to the reactor.
With more catalyst present in the vessel, higher rates of sub-
strate utilisation and product formation can be achieved. With
cell recycle, the critical dilution rate for washout is also
increased allowing greater operating flexibility.
There are several ways by which cells can be recycled inI3 ReactorEn

of a Plug-Flow
Plug-flow operation is an alternative to mixed operation for
continuous reactors. No mixing occurs in an ideal plug-flow
reactor; liquid entering the reactor passes through as a discrete
'plug' and does not interact with neighbouring fluid elements.
This is achieved at high flow rates which minimise backmixing
and variations in liquid velocity. Plug flow is most readily
achieved in column or tubular reactors such as that shown in
Figure 13.32. Plug-flow reactors can be operated in upflow or

In Eq. (6.5), ATIi is the mass flow rate of substrate entering
the system; therefore ATIi = Fslz where Fis the volumetric flow
rate through the reactor and Slz is the substrate concentration
at z. Similarly, ATIo, the mass flow rate of substrate leaving the
section, is FSIz+Az. Substrate is not generated in the reaction;
therefore R G = 0. Rate ofsubstrate consumption R e is equal to
the volumetric rate of reaction v multiplied by the volume of
the section, v is given by Eq. (11.31); the section volume is
equal to AAzwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the reactor.

downflow mode or, in some cases, horizontally. Plug-flow
tubular reactors are known by the abbreviation PFTR.
Liquid in a PFTR flows at constant velocity; thus all parts
of the liquid have identical residence time in the reactor. As
reaction in the vessel proceeds, concentration gradients of sub-
strate and product develop in the direction of flow. At the
feed-end of the PFTR the substrate concentration will be high
and the product concentration low because the reaction mix-
ture has just entered the vessel; at the end of the tube the
substrate concentration will be low and the product level high.
Consider operation of the PFTR shown in Figure 13.32.
The volumetric liquid flow rate through the vessel is F; the
feed stream contains substrate at concentration si. At the reac-
tor outlet, the substrate concentration is sf. This exit
concentration can be related to the inlet conditions and reac-
tor residence time using mass-balance techniques. Let us first
consider plug-flow operation for enzyme reaction.
13.5.8.1
E n z y m e reaction
To develop equations for a plug-flow enzyme reactor, we must
consider a small section ofthe reactor of length Az as indicated
in Figure 13.32. This section is located at distance z from the
feed point. Let us perform a steady-state mass balance on sub-
strate around the section using Eq. (6.5).

Eqs (13.84) and (13.86) allow us to calculate the reactor length
and residence time required to achieve conversion of substrate
from concentration si to sf at flow rate u. The form of Eq.
(13.86) is identical to that of Eq. (13.10) for batch reactors. As
in batch reactors where substrate and product concentrations
vary continuously during the reaction period, concentrations in
plug-flow reactors change continuously as material moves from
inlet to outlet. Thus, plug-flow operation can be seen as a way of
simulating batch culture in a continuous flow system.
Plug-flow operation is generally impractical for enzyme
conversions unless the enzyme is immobilised and retained
inside the vessel. For immobilised-enzyme reactions affected
by diffusion, Eq. (13.83) must be modified to account for

sic kinetic parameters. Because 77T is a function of s, we cannot
integrate Eq. (13.87) directly as s varies with z in plug-flow
reactors.

likely to be approached in packed-bed reactors such as that
shown in Figure 13.8. Packing in the column can cause
substantial backmixing and axial dispersion of liquid,
thus interfering with ideal plug flow. Nevertheless, applica-
tion of the equations developed in this section can give
satisfactory results for design of fixed-bed immobilised-
enzyme reactors.

Immobilised lactase is used to hydrolyse lactose in dairy waste to glucose and galactose. Enzyme is immobilised in resin particles
and packed into a 0.5 m 3 column. The total effectiveness factor for the system is close to unity; K m for the immobilised enzyme
is 1.32 kg m-3; Vmax is 45 kg m -3 h -1. The lactose concentration in the feed stream is 9.5 kg m-3; a substrate conversion of
98% is required. The column is operated with plug flow for a total of 310 d per year.
(a) At what flow rate should the reactor be operated?
(b) How many tonnes of glucose are produced per year?
Solution:
(a) For 98% substrate conversion, sf= (0.02 si) = 0.19 kg m -3. Substituting into Eq. (13.86) gives:

13.5.8.2
Cell culture
Analysis of plug-flow reactors for cell culture follows the same
procedure as for enzyme reaction. If the cell specific growth
rate is constant and equal to jUmax throughout the reactor and
cell death can be neglected, the equations for reactor residence
time are analogous to those derived in Section 13.5.1.2 for
batch fermentation, e.g.:
xf
ln--
~max
Xi
(13.88)
where z"is the reactor residence time defined in Eq. (13.51), x i
is the biomass concentration at the inlet and xf is the biomass
concentration at the outlet. The form of Eq. (13.88) is identi-
cal to that of Eq. (13.20) for batch reaction.
Plug-flow operation is not suitable for cultivation of sus-
pended cells unless the biomass is recycled or there is
continuous inoculation of the vessel. Plug-flow operation with
cell recycle is used for large-scale wastewater treatment; how-
ever applications are limited. Plug-flow reactors are suitable
for immobilised-cell reactions with catalyst packed into a fixed
bed as shown in Figure 13.8. Even so, operating problems
such as those mentioned in Section 13.2.5 mean that PFTRs
are rarely employed for industrial fermentations.
13.5.9 Comparison
Reactor Operation
Between Major Modes of
The relative performance of batch, CSTR and PFTR reactors
can be considered from a theoretical point of view in terms of
the substrate conversion and product concentration obtained
from vessels of the same size. Because the total reactor volume
is not fully utilised at all times during fed-batch operation, it is
difficult to include this mode of operation in a general com-
parison.
As indicated in Section 13.5.8, the kinetic characteristics
of PFTRs are the same as batch reactors; the residence time
required for conversion in a plug-flow reactor is therefore the
same as in a mixed vessel operated in batch. It can also be
shown theoretically that as the number of stages in a CSTR
cascade increases, the conversion characteristics of the entire
system approach those of an ideal plug-flow or mixed batch
reactor. This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 13.33. The
smooth dashed curve represents the progressive decrease in
substrate concentration with time spent in a PFTR or batch
reactor; concentration is reduced from si at the inlet to sf at the
outlet. In a single well-mixed CSTR operated with the same
inlet and outlet concentrations, because conditions in the
vessel are uniform there is a step change in substrate
concentration as soon as the feed enters the reactor. In a cas-
cade of CSTRs, the concentration is uniform in each reactor
but there is a step-wise drop in concentration between each
stage. As illustrated in Figure 13.33, the larger the number of
units in a CSTR cascade, the closer the concentration profile
approaches plug-flow or batch behaviour.
The benefits associated with particular reactor designs or
modes of operation depend on the kinetic characteristics of the
reaction. For zero-order reactions there is no difference
between single batch, CSTR and P FTR reactors in terms of
overall conversion rate. However, for most reactions including
first-order and Michaelis-Menten conversions, rate of reac-
tion decreases as the concentration of substrate decreases.
Reaction rate is therefore high at the start of batch culture or at
the entrance to a plug-flow reactor because the substrate level
is greatest. Subsequently, the reaction velocity falls gradually as
substrate is consumed. In contrast, substrate entering a CSTR
is immediately diluted to the final or outlet steady-state con-
centration so that the rate of reaction is comparatively low for
the entire reactor. Accordingly, for first-order and
Michaelis-Menten reactions, CSTRs achieve lower substrate
conversions and lower product concentrations than batch
reactors or PFTRs of the same volume. In practice, batch pro-
cessing is much preferred to PFTR systems because of the
operating problems mentioned in Section 13.2.5. However, as
discussed in Section 13.5.2, the total time for batch operation
depends on the duration of the downtime between batches as
well as on the actual conversion time. Because the length of
downtime varies considerably from system to system, we can-
not account for it here in a general way. Downtime between
batches should be minimised as much as possible to maintain
high overall production rates.
The comparison between reactors yields a different result if
the reaction is autocatalytic. Catalyst is produced by the reaction
in fermentation processes; therefore, the volumetric rate ofreac-I3 Reactor Engineering

tion increases as the conversion proceeds because the amount of
catalyst builds up. Volumetric reaction rate continues to
increase until the substrate concentration becomes low, then it
declines due to substrate depletion. At the beginning of batch
culture, rate of substrate conversion is generally low because
relatively few cells are present; it takes some time for cells to
accumulate and the rate to pick up. However, in CSTR opera-
tion, substrate entering the vessel is immediately exposed to a
relatively high biomass concentration so that the rate of conver-
sion is also high. Rates of conversion in chemostats operated
closeto the optimum dilution rate for biomass productivity (see
Section 13.5.4.2) are often 10-20 times greater than in PFTR or
batch reactors. This rate advantage disappears if the steady-state
substrate concentration in the CSTR is so small that, despite the
higher biomass levels present, the conversion rate is lower than
the average in a batch or PFTR device. For most fermentations
however, CSTRs offer significant theoretical advantages over
other modes of reactor operation.
Despite the productivity benefits associated with CSTRs, an
overwhelming majority of commercial fermentations are con-
ducted in batch. The reasons lie with the practical advantages
associated with batch culture. Batch processes have a lower risk
of contamination than continuous-flow reactors; equipment
and control failures during long-term continuous operation are
also potential problems. Continuous fermentation is feasible
only when the cells are genetically stable; if developed strains
revert to more rapidly-growing mutants the culture can
become dominated over time by the revertant cells. In contrast,
freshly-produced inocula are used in batch fermentations giv-
ing closer control over the genetic characteristics of the culture.
Continuous culture is not suitable for production of metab-
olites normally formed near stationary phase when the culture
growth rate is low; as mentioned above, productivity in a batch
reactor is likely to be greater than in a CSTR under these condi-
tions. Continuous fermentations must be operated for lengthy
periods to reap the full benefits of their high productivity.
Production can be much more flexible with batch processing;
for example, different products each with small market vol-
umes can be made in different batches.

Culture
In a steady-state chemostat with sterile feed and negligible cell
death, the specific growth rate/u is equal to the dilution rate D.
This relationship is useful for determining kinetic and yield
parameters in cell culture. If growth can be modelling using
Monod kinetics, for chemostat culture, Eq. (11.60) becomes:

where jUmax is the maximum specific growth rate, K s is the sub-
strate constant and s is the steady-state substrate concentration
in the reactor. Eq. (13.89) is analogous mathematically to the
Michaelis-Menten expressioja for enzyme kinetics. If sis meas-
ured at various dilution rates, techniques described in Section
11.4 for determining Vmax and K m can be applied for evalua-
tion of/%ax and K s. Rearrangement of Eq. (13.89) gives the
following linearised equations which can be used for

For example, according to Eq. (13.90),/~max and K s can be

distortion of experimental error apply also to Eqs
(13.90)-(13.92).
Chemostat operation is also convenient for determining
true yields and maintenance coefficients for cell cultures. An
expression relating these parameters to the specific growth rate
is given by Eq. (11.81) In chemostat culture with/~ = D, Eq.

Sterilisation
Commercial fermentations typically require thousands of
litres of liquid medium and millions of litres of air. For pro-
cesses operated with axenic cultures, these raw materials must
be provided free from contaminating organisms. Of all the
methods available for sterilisation including chemical treat-
ment, exposure to ultraviolet, gamma and X-ray radiation,
sonication, filtration and heating, only the last two are used in
large-scale operations. Aspects of fermenter design and con-
struction for aseptic operation were considered in Sections
13.3.1 and 13.3.2. Here, we consider design of sterilisation
systems for liquids and gases.
13.6.1
Batch Heat Sterilisation of Liquids
Liquid medium is most commonly sterilised in batch in the
vessel where it will be used. The liquid is heated to sterilisation
temperature by introducing steam into the coils or jacket of
v
1
D
the vessel; alternatively, steam is bubbled directly into the
medium, or the vessel is heated electrically. If direct steam
injection is used, allowance must be made for dilution of the
medium by condensate which typically adds 10-20% to the
liquid volume; quality of the steam must also be sufficiently
high to avoid contamination of the medium by metal ions or
organics. A typical temperature-time profile for batch steril-
isation is shown in Figure 13.35(a). Depending on the rate of
heat transfer from the steam or electrical element, raising the
temperature of the medium in large fermenters can take a sig-
nificant period of time. Once the holding or sterilisation
temperature is reached, the temperature is held constant for a
period of time thd. Cooling water in the coils or jacket of the
fermenter is then used to reduce the medium temperature to
the required value.
For operation of batch sterilisation systems, we must be
able to estimate the holding time required to achieve the
desired level of cell destruction. As well as destroying contami-
nant organisms, heat sterilisation also destroys nutrients in the
medium. To minimise this loss, holding times at the highest
sterilisation temperature should be kept as short as possible.
Cell death occurs at all times during batch sterilisation, includ-
ing the heating-up and cooling-down periods. The holding
time thd can be minimised by taking into account cell destruc-
tion during these periods.
Let us denote the number of contaminants present in the
raw medium N 0. As indicated in Figure 13.35(b), during theI3 Reactor Engineering

Rate of heat sterilisation is governed by the equations for
thermal death outlined in Section 11.14. From Eq. (11.86) for
first-order death kinetics, in a batch vessel where cell death is
the only process affecting the number of viable cells:

where Nis number of viable cells, t is time and k d is the specific

sterilisation cycle: heating, holding and cooling. However,
because k d is a strong function of temperature, direct integra-
tion of Eq. (13.95) is valid only when the temperature is
constant, i.e. during the holding period. The result is:

where thd is the holding time, N 1 is the number of viable cells
at the start of holding, and N 2 is the number of viable cells at
the end of holding, k d is evaluated as a function of temperature
using the Arrhenius equation:
k d = A e-Ea/RT
(11.46)
heating period this number is reduced to N 1. At the end of the
holding period, the cell number is N2; the final number after
cooling is Nf. Ideally, Nf is zero; at the end of the sterilisation
cycle we want to have no contaminants present. However,
because absolute sterility would require an infinitely-long
sterilisation time, it is theoretically impossible to achieve.
Normally, the target level of contamination is expressed as a
fraction of a cell, which is related to the probability o f contami-
nation. For example, we could aim for an Nf value of 10-3;
this means we accept the risk that one batch in 1000 will not
be sterile at the end of the process. If N Oand Nf are known, we
can determine the holding time required to reduce the number
of cells from N 1 to N 2 by considering the kinetics of cell death.
where A is the Arrhenius constant or frequency factor, E d is the
activation energy for the thermal cell death, R is the ideal gas
constant and Tis absolute temperature.
To use Eq. (13.97) we must know N 1 and N 2. These num-
bers are determined by considering the extent of cell death
during the heating and cooling periods when the temperature
is not constant. Combining Eqs (13.95) and (11.46) gives:

where t1 is the time at the end of heating, t2 isthe time at the
end of holding and tfis the time at the end of cooling. We can-
not complete integration of these equations until we know how
the temperature varies with time during heating and cooling.
As outlined in Chapter 6, unsteady-state temperature pro-
files during heating and cooling can be determined from the
heat transfer properties of the system. The general form of
these equations is shown in Figure 13.36 and Table 13.3.
Applying an appropriate expression for Tin Eq. (13.9.9) from
Table 13.3 allows us to evaluate the cell number N 1 at the start
of the holding period. Similarly, substituting for T in Eq.
(13.100) for cooling gives N 2 at the end of the holding period.
Use of the resulting values for N 1 and N 2 in Eq. (13.97) com-
pletes the holding-time calculation.
Normally, cell death below about 100~ is minimal; how-
ever, when heating and cooling are relatively slow,
temperatures remain close to the maximum for considerable
periods of time and, as indicated in Figure 13.35(b), cell num-
bers can be reduced significantly outside of the holding period.
Usually, holding periods are of the order of minutes whereas
heating and cooling of large liquid volumes take hours. Sample
design calculations for batch sterilisation are given by Aiba,
Humphrey and Millis [40] and Richards [41].
The design procedures outlined in this section apply to
batch sterilisation of medium when the temperature is uni-
form throughout the vessel. However, if the liquid contains
contaminant particles in the form of flocs or pellets, tempera-
ture gradients may develop. Because heat transfer within solid
particles is slower than in liquid, the temperature at the centre
of the solid will be lower than that in the liquid for some pro-
portion of the sterilising time. As a result, cell death inside the
particles is not as effective as in the liquid. Longer holding
times are required to treat solid-phase substrates and media
containing particles.
When heat sterilisation is scaled up to larger volumes, long-
er treatment times are needed to achieve the same sterilisation
results at the same holding temperature. For a given raw
medium, the initial number of organisms N O is directly
proportional to the liquid volume; therefore, to obtain the13 Reactor Engineering

Scale-up also affects the temperature-time profiles for heating
and cooling. Heat-transfer characteristics depend on the
equipment used; heating and cooling of larger volumes usually
take more time. Sustained elevated temperatures during heat-
ing and cooling are damaging to vitamins, proteins and sugars
in nutrient solutions and reduce the quality of the medium
[42]. Because it is necessary to hold large volumes of medium
for longer periods of time, this problem is exacerbated with
scale-up.

to medium ingredients while achieving high levels of cell
destruction. Other advantages include improved steam econ-
omy and more reliable scale-up. The amount of steam
needed for continuous sterilisation is 20-25% that used in
batch processes; the time required is also significantly reduced
because heating and cooling are virtually instantaneous.
Typical equipment configurations for continuous sterilisa-
tion are shown in Figure 13.37. In Figure 13.37(a), raw
medium entering the system is first pre-heated by hot, sterile
medium in a heat exchanger; this economises on steam require~
ments for heating and cools the sterile medium. Steam is then
injected directly into the medium as it flows through a pipe; the
liquid temperature rises almost instantaneously to the desired
sterilisation temperature. The time of exposure to this tempera-
ture depends on the length of pipe in the holding section of the
steriliser. After sterilisation, the medium is cooled instantly by
passing it through an expansion valve into a vacuum chamber;
further cooling takes place in the heat exchanger where residual
heat is used to pre-heat incoming medium. Figure 13.37(b)
shows an alternative sterilisation scheme based on heat exchange
between steam and medium. Raw medium is pre-heated with
hot, sterile medium in a heat exchanger then brought to the ster-
ilisation temperature by further heat exchange with steam. The
sterilisation temperature is maintained in the holding section
before being reduced to the fermentation temperature by heat
exchange with incoming medium. Heat-exchange systems are
more expensive to construct than injection devices; fouling of
the internal surfaces also reduces the efficiency of heat transfer
between cleanings. On the other hand, a disadvantage associ-
ated with steam injection is diludon of the medium by
condensate; foaming from direct steam injection can also cause
problems with operation of the flash cooler. As indicated in
Figure 13.38, rates of heating and cooling in continuous steril-
isation are much more rapid than in batch; accordingly, in
design of continuous sterilisers, contributions to cell death out-
side of the holding period are generally ignored.
An important variable affecting performance of continuous
sterilisers is the nature of fluid flow in the system. Ideally, all
fluid entering the equipment at a particular instant should
spend the same time in the steriliser and exit the system at the
same time; unless this occurs we cannot fully control the time
spent in the steriliser by all fluid elements. No mixing should13 Reactor Engineering

occur in the tubes; if fluid nearer the entrance of the pipe mixes
with fluid ahead of it, there is a risk that contaminants will be
transferred to the outlet of the steriliser. The type of flow in
pipes where there is neither mixing nor variation in fluid
velocity is called plugflowas already described in Section 13.5.8
for plug-flow reactors. Plug flow is an ideal flow pattern; in real-
ity, fluid elements in pipes have a range of different velocities.
As illustrated in Figure 13.39, flow tends to be faster through
the centre of the tube than near the walls. However, plug flow is
approached in pipes at turbulent Reynolds numbers (see
Section 7.2.2) above about 2 • 104; operation at high Reynolds
numbers minimises fluid mixing and velocity variation.
Deviation from plug-flow behaviour is characterised by the
degree of axial dispersion in the system, i.e. the degree to which
mixing occurs along the length or axis of the pipe. Axial disper-
sion is a critical factor affecting design of continuous sterilisers.
The relative importance of axial dispersion and bulk flow in
transfer of material through the pipe is represented by a
dimensionless variable called the Peclet number:I3 Reactor Engineering

where Pe is the Peclet number, u is the average linear fluid
velocity, L is the pipe length and -~z is the axial-dispersion
coefficient. For perfect plug flow, "~z is zero and Pe is infinitel)
large; in practice, Peclet numbers between 3 and 600 are typi-
cal. The value of ~z for a particular system depends on the
Reynolds number and pipe geometry; a correlation from the
engineering literature for evaluating -~z is shown in Figure
13.40. Once the Peclet number has been calculated from Eq.
(13.101), the extent of cell destruction in the steriliser can be
related to the specific death constant kd using Figure 13.41. In
Figure 13.41, N 1 is the number of viable cells entering the
system, N 2 is the number of cells leaving, Pe is the Peclet
number as defined by Eq. (13.101), and Da is another
dimensionless number called the Damkiihler number:

Example 13.8 Holding temperature in a continuous steriliser
Medium at a flow rate of 2 m 3 h-1 is to be sterilised by heat exchange with steam in a continuous steriliser. The liquid contains
bacterial spores at a concentration of 5 • 1012 m-3; the activation energy and Arrhenius constant for thermal destruction of these
contaminants are 283 kJ gmol-1 and 5.7 x 10 39 h-1, respectively. A contamination risk of one organism surviving every 60
days' operation is considered acceptable. The steriliser pipe has an inner diameter of 0.1 m; the length of the holding section is
24 m. The density of the medium is 1000 kg m -3 and the viscosity is 3.6 kg m - 1 h - 1. What sterilising temperature is required?
Solution:
The desired level of cell destruction is evaluated using a basis of 60 days. Ignoring any cell death in the heating and cooling
sections, the number of cells entering the holding section over 60 d is:
N 1=2m3h -1(5x1012m-3).

For Re= 7.07 x 103 we can determine "~z from Figure 13.40 using either the experimental or theoretical curve. Let us choose the
experimental curve as this gives a larger value of.~ z and a smaller value ofPe ; the steriliser design will thus be more conservative.
Therefore, "-~z/uD= 0.65"

Heating and cooling in continuous sterilisers are so rapid that
in design calculations they are considered instantaneous.
While reducing nutrient deterioration, this feature of the pro-
cess can cause problems if there are solids present in the
medium. During heating, the temperature at the core of solid
particles remains lower than in the medium. Because of the
extremely short contact times in continuous sterilisers com-
pared with batch systems, there is a greater risk that particles
will not be properly sterilised. It is important therefore that
raw medium be clarified as much as possible before it enters a
continuous steriliser.
13.6.3
Filter Sterilisation of Liquids
Sometimes, fermentation media or selected ingredients are
sterilised by filtration rather than heat. For example, media
containing heat-labile components such as enzymes and
serum are easily destroyed by heat and must be sterilised by
other means. Typically, membranes used for filter sterilisation
of liquids are made of cellulose esters or other polymers and
have pores between 0.2 and 0.45 pm in diameter. The mem-
branes themselves must be sterilised before use, usually by
steam. As medium is passed through the filter, bacteria and
other particles with dimensions greater than the pore size are
screened out and collect on the surface of the membrane. The
small pore sizes used in liquid filtration mean that the mem-
branes are readily blocked unless the medium is pre-filtered to
remove any large particles. To achieve high flow rates, large
surface areas are required.
Liquid filtration is generally not as effective or reliable as
heat sterilisation. Viruses and mycoplasma are able to pass
through membrane filters; care must also be taken to prevent
holes or tears in the membrane. Usually, filter-sterilised
medium is incubated for a period of time before use to test
its sterility.
13.6.4
Sterilisation of Air
The number of microbial cells in air is of the order
103-104 m -3 [40]. Filtration is the most common method for
sterilising air in large-scale bioprocesses; heat sterilisation of
gases is economically impractical. Depth filters consisting of
compacted beds or pads of fibrous material such as glass wool
have been used widely in the fermentation industry. Distances
between the fibres in depth filters are typically 2-10 pm, about
10 times greater than the dimensions of the bacteria and spores
to be removed. Air-borne particles penetrate the bed to various
depths before their passage through the filter is arrested; the
depth of the filter medium required to produce air of sufficient
386
quality depends on the operating flow rate and the incoming
level of contamination. Cells are collected in depth filters by a
combination of impaction, interception, electrostatic effects,
and, for particles smaller than about 1.0 pm, diffusion to the
fibres. Depth filters do not perform well if there are large fluc-
tuations in flow rate or if the air is wet; liquid condensing in
the filter increases the pressure drop, causes channelling of the
gas flow, and provides a pathway for organisms to grow
through the bed.
Increasingly, depth filters are being replaced for industrial
applications by membrane cartridge filters. These filters use
steam-sterilisable polymeric membranes which act as su~Cace
filters trapping contaminants as on a sieve. Membrane filter
cartridges typically contain a pleated, hydrophobic filter with
small and uniformly-sized pores 0.45 pm or less in diameter.
The hydrophobic nature of the surface minimises problems
with filter wetting while the pleated configuration allows a
high filtration area to be packed into a small cartridge volume.
Pre-filters built into the cartridge or up-stream reduce fouling
of the membrane by removing large particles, oil, water drop-
lets and foam from the incoming gas.
Filters are also used to sterilise effluent gases leaving fer-
menters. In this application, the objective is to prevent release
into the atmosphere of any microorganisms entrained in aero-
sols in the headspace of the reactor. The concentration of cells
in fermenter off-gas is several times greater than in air.
Containment is particularly important when organisms used
in fermentation are potentially harmful to plant personnel or
the environment; companies operating fermentations with
pathogenic or recombinant strains are required by regulatory
authorities to prevent escape of the cells.

(aspartic acid)
Under investigation is a process using aspartase in intact
Bacillus cadaveris cells. In the substrate range of interest, the
conversion can be described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics
with K m 4.0 g 1-1. The substrate solution contains 15% (w/v)
ammonium fumarate; enzyme is added in the form oflyophil-
ised cells and the reaction stopped when 85% of the substrate
is converted. At 32~ Vmax for the enzyme is 5.9 g l-1 h - 1
and its half-life is 10.5 d. At 37~
Vmax increases to
8.5 g l- 1 h - I but the half-life is reduced to 2.3 d.
(a) Which operating temperature would you recommend?
(b) The average downtime between batch reactions is 28 h. At
the temperature chosen in (a), calculate the reactor volume
required to produce 5000 tonnes ofaspartic acid per year.
Problems
13.1 Economics of batch enzyme conversion
An enzyme is used to convert substrate to a commercial prod-
uct in a 1600-1itre batch reactor. Vmax for the enzyme is
0.9 g 1-1 h-l; Km is 1.5 g 1-1. Substrate concentration at the
start of the reaction is 3 g l-1; according to the stoichiometry
of the reaction, conversion of 1 g substrate produces 1.2 g
product. The cost of operating the reactor including labour,
maintenance, energy and other utilities is estimated at $4800
per day. The cost of recovering the product depends on tl~e
extent ofsubstrate conversion and the resulting concentration
of product in the final reaction mixture. For conversions
between 70% and 100%, the cost of downstream processing
can be approximated using the equation:
C = 155 - 0.33X
where C is cost in $ per kg product treated and X is the per-
centage substrate conversion. The market price for the
product is $750 kg-1. Currently, the enzyme reactor is oper-
ated With 75% substrate conversion; however it is proposed to
increase this to 90%. Estimate the effect this will have on the
economics of the process.
13.2 Batch production of aspartic acid using
cell-bound enzyme
Aspartase enzyme is used industrially for manufacture of
aspartic acid, a component of low-calorie sweetener. Fumaric
acid and ammonia are converted to aspartic acid according to
the equation:
13.3 Prediction of batch culture time
A strain of Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered to
produce human protein. A batch culture is started by inoculat-
ing 12 g cells into a 100-1itre bubble-column fermenter
containing 10 g l- 1 glucose. The maximum specific growth
rate of the culture is 0.9 h - 1; the biomass yield from glucose is
0.575 g g -1 .
(a) Estimate the time required to reach stationary phase.
(b) What will be the final cell density if the fermentation is
stopped after only 70% of the substrate is consumed?
13.4 Fed-batch scheduling
Nicotiana tabacum cells are cultured to high density for pro-
duction of polysaccharide gum. The reactor used is a stirred
tank, containing initially 100 litres medium. The maximum
specific growth rate of the culture is 0:18 d-1 and the yield of
biomass from substrate is 0.5 g g-l. The concentration of
growth-limiting substrate in the medium is 3% (w/v). The
reactor is inoculated with 1.5 g l- 1 cells and operated in batch
until the substrate is virtually exhausted; medium flow is then
started at a rate of 4 1 d-1. Fed-batch operation occurs under
quasi-steady-state conditions.
(a) Estimate the batch culture time and final biomass concen-
tration.
(b) Fed-batch operation is carried out for 40 d. What is the
final mass of cells in the reactor?
(c) The fermenter is available 275 d per year with a downtime
between runs of 24 h. How much plant cell biomass is
produced annually?I3 Reactor Engineering

13.6 Continuous
f i x e d - b e d reactor
e n z y m e c o n v e r s i o n in a
A system is being developed to remove urea from the blood of
patients with renal failure. A prototype fixed-bed reactor is set
up with urease immobilised in 2-mm gel beads; buffered urea
solution is recycled rapidly through the bed so that the system
is well mixed. The urease reaction is:
(NH2)2CO + 3 H 2 0 ---) 2 NH4 + + H C O 3- + O H - .
K m for the immobilised urease is 0.54 g 1-1. The volume of
beads in the reactor is 250 cm 3, the total amount of urease is
10 -4 g, and the turnover number is 11 000 g NH4 § (g
enzyme)-1 s-1. The effective diffusivity of urease in the gel is
7 x 10 -6 cm 2 s- 1; external mass-transfer effects are negligible.
The reactor is operated continuously with a liquid volume of
1 litre. The feed stream contains 0.42 g l-1 urea; the desired
urea concentration is 0.02 g l-1. Ignoring enzyme deactiva-
tion, what volume of urea solution can be treated in 30 min?
fermenter. The biomass yield from substrate is 0.41 g g- 1, KS is
0.7 mg l- 1, and the maximum specific growth rate is 0.44 h - 1.
The medium contains 4% (w/v) methanol. A substrate conver-
sion of 98% is desirable. The reactor may be operated either in
batch or continuous mode. If operated in batch, an inoculum of
0.01% (w/v) is used and the downtime between batches is 20 h.
If operated continuously, a downtime of 25 d is expected per
year. Neglecting maintenance requirements, compare the annu-
al biomass production from batch and continuous reactors.
13.8
Reactor design for immobilised enzymes
6-Aminopenicillanic acid used to produce semi-synthetic penicil-
lins is prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of fermentation-derived
penicillin G. Penicillin acylase immobilised in alginate is being
considered for the process; the immobilised-enzyme particles are
small enough that mass-transfer effects can be ignored. The start-
ing concentration of penicillin G is 10% (w/v); because of the
high cost of the substrate, 99% conversion is required. Under
these conditions, enzymatic conversion of penicillin G can be
considered a first-order reaction. It has not been decided whether
a batch, CSTR or plug-flow reactor would be most suitable. The
downtime between batch reactions is expected to be 20 h. For the
batch and CSTR reactors, the reaction rate constant is 0.8 •
10 -4 s-1; in the PFTR, the packing density ofenzyme beads can
be up to four times greater than in the other reactors. Determine
the smallest reactor required to treat 400 tonnes penicillin G per
year.
13.9 Two-stage chemostat for secondary
metabolite production
A two-stage chemostat system is used for production of sec-
ondary metabolite. The volume of each reactor is 0.5 m3; the
flow rate of feed is 50 1 h - 1. Mycelial growth occurs in the first
reactor; the second reactor is used for product synthesis. The
concentration of substrate in the feed is 10 g 1-1. Kinetic and
yield parameters for the organism are:

13.10 Kinetic analysis ofbioremediating
bacteria using a chemostat
A strain of Ancylobacter bacteria capable of growing on 1,2-
dichloroethane is isolated from sediment in the river Rhine.
The bacteria are to be used for on-site bioremediation of soil
contaminated with chlorinated halogens. Kinetic parameters
for the organism are determined using chemostat culture. A
1-1itre fermenter is used with a 1,2-dichloroethane feed at a
concentration of 100 ~iM. Steady-state substrate concentra-
tions are measured as a function of flow rate.
Determine the maximum specific growth rate, the substrate
constant K s, the maintenance coefficient, and the true bio-
mass yield for this culture.

(laM)A 15-m 3 chemostat is operated with dilution rate 0.1 h-1. A
continuous steriliser with steam injection and flash cooling
delivers sterilised medium to the fermenter. Medium in the
holding section of the steriliser is maintained at 130~ The
concentration of contaminants in the raw medium is
105 ml-l; an acceptable contamination risk is one organism
every 3 months. The Arrhenius constant and activation energy
for thermal death are estimated to be 7.5 • 1039 h-1 and
288.5 kJ gmol- 1, respectively. The steriliser pipe inner diam-
eter is 12 cm. At 130~ the liquid density is 1000 kg m - 3 and
the viscosity is 4 kg m - 1 h - 1.

Example. For acetone gas between 0~ and 1200"C:
Cp (J gmo1-1 *C-l) = 71.96 + (20.10 x 10 -2) T - (12.78 x 10 -5) T 2 + (34.76 x 10 -9) T3, where Tisin *C.
Note that some equations require Tin K, as indicated.

Mathematical Rules
In this Appendix, some simple rules for logarithms, differentiation and integration are presented. Further details of mathematical functions can be found in
handbooks, e.g. [1-4].
D. 1 Logarithms
The naturallogarithm (In or log~) is the inverse of the exponential function. Therefore, if:
y = In x
(D.1)
then
d=x
(D.2)
where the number eis approximately 2.71828. It also follows that:
In (d) =y
(D.3)
and
elnx= x.
(D.4)
Natural logarithms are related to common logarithms, or logarithms to the base 10 (written as lg, log or log10), as follows:
In x= In 10 (lOgl0x).
(D.5)
Since In 10 is approximately 2.30259:
In x= 2.30259 logl0x.
(D.6)
Zero and negative numbers do not have logarithms.
Rules for taking logarithms of products and powers are illustrated below. The logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms:
In (a x) = In a + In x.
(D.7)
When one term of the product involves an exponential function, application ofEqs (D.7) and (D.3) gives:
In (be a~) = In b +.ax.
(D.8)
The logarithm of the quotient of two numbers is equal to the logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the denominator:Appendices
4i 4
In(a)= lna-lnx.
(D.9)
As an example of this rule, because In 1 = 0:
(D.10)
The rule for taking the logarithm of a power function is as follows:
In (x b) - b In x.
(D.11)
D.2 Differentiation
The derivative ofywith respect to x, dY/dx, is defined as the limit of AY/Axas Axapproaches zero, provided this limit exists:
dx
0-~"
(D.12)
That is:
dY = AxlLm0
dx
Ylx,~-Y]x
Ax
(D.13)
where y [0, means the value of y evaluated at x, and y l,,. Ax means the value of y evaluated at x + Ax. The operation of calculating the derivative is called
differentiation.
There are simple rules for rapid evaluation of derivatives. Derivatives of various functions with respect to x are listed below; in all these equations A is a
constant:
dA
dx
-0
(D.14)
dx
dx
-1
(D.15)
d
d--'x(eX)=e"
(D.16)
d
(e~).= Ae ~
(D.17)
and
d
1
- ~ (In x ) = - x "
(D.18)Appendices
415
When a function is multiplied by a constant, the constant can be taken out of the differential. For example:
d
dx
d---~(Ax) = A ~ = A
(D.19)
and
d
d
A
(A In x) = A dx (In x) = --'x
(D.20)
When a function consists of a sum of terms, the derivative of the sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives. Therefore, if f (x) and g(x) are functions of w.
d
d x [ f ( x ) +g(x)]=
+ dxdg"
(D.21)
To illustrate application ofEq. (D.21), for A and B constants:
d [ A x + e Bx] d(Ax) d(e Bx)
d---x
= - - ~ - + - - ~ = A + BeBx "
When a function consists of terms multiplied together, the product rule for derivatives is:
d
dg
df
[ f (x). g(x)] = f ( x ) ~ + g ( x ) ~
.
(D.22)
As an example of the product rule:
d
d(Ax)
d (In
[ (Ax). In x] = Ax. 9 dx x)+ In x. dx
1
= A x . - +In x. (A)
x
= A(1 + In x).
D.3 Integration
The integral ofy with respect to x is indicated as fy dx. The function to be integrated (y) is called the integrand; the symbol f is the integral sign. Integration is
the opposite of differentiation; integration is the process of finding a function from its derivative.
From Eq. (D.14), if the derivative of a constant is zero, the integral of zero must be a constant:
f Odx=K
(D.23)
where Kis a constant. Kis called the constant of integration, and appears whenever a function is integrated. For example, the integral of constant A with respect to
xis:
f A dx =Ax + K
(D.24)
We can check that Eq. (D.24) is correct by taking the derivative of the right-hand side and making sure it is equal to the integrand, A. Although the equation:
f A dx - AxAppendices
416
is also correct, addition of Kin Eq. (D.24) makes solution of the integral complete. Addition of Kaccounts for the possibility that the answer we are looking for
may have an added constant that disappears when the derivative is taken. Irrespective of the value of K; the derivative of the integral will always be the same
because d~dx= 0. Extra information is needed to evaluate the actual magnitude of K; this point is considered further in Chapter 6 where integration is used to
solve unsteady-state mass and energy problems.
The integral ofdY/dxwith respect to x is:
dy
f~dx=y+K.
(D.25)
When a function is multiplied by a constant, the constant can be taken out of the integral. For example, forf(x) a function of x, and A a constant:
fAr(x) dx = A f f(x)dx.
(D.26)
Other rules of integration are:
fdx=fldx-lnx+K
x
x
(D.27)
and, for A and B constants:
(am)= f ("A+Bx
, ) dx =--B1 In(A+Bx)+K.
f A+Bx
(D.28)
The results of Eqs (D.27) and (D.28) can be confirmed by differentiating the right-hand sides of the equations with respect to x.
