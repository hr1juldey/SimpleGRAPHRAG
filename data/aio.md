## The Hidden Garden

In a small town, there was a garden hidden behind a tall wall. The townsfolk often whispered about it, saying it was enchanted. No one had seen the inside, but everyone had their own stories. Some said it was filled with flowers that could sing, while others believed it was home to a wise old owl that could grant wishes.

One sunny afternoon, a curious girl named Lily decided to explore the garden. She had always been fascinated by the stories and wanted to see if they were true. As she approached the wall, she noticed a small, rusty gate slightly ajar. With her heart racing, she pushed it open and stepped inside.

The garden was more beautiful than she had imagined. Colorful flowers bloomed everywhere, and the air was filled with sweet scents. In the center stood an ancient oak tree, its branches stretching wide, offering shade to a small stone bench. As she walked closer, she noticed a figure sitting on the bench—a boy about her age, with messy brown hair and bright green eyes.

“Hi, I’m Jack,” he said, smiling. “I come here to think.”

“Hi, I’m Lily,” she replied, feeling a strange connection with him. “I’ve heard so many stories about this place.”

Jack nodded. “Most of them are true. The flowers do sing, but only when they feel happy. And the owl? He’s real too. He watches over the garden.”

Lily’s eyes widened. “Can we see him?”

Jack hesitated. “He only appears when he senses someone who truly believes in magic.”

Lily felt a spark of determination. “I believe! Let’s find him!”

Together, they explored the garden, laughing and sharing stories. They discovered a patch of flowers that began to hum softly when they danced around them. The more they danced, the louder the flowers sang, filling the air with joy.

As they played, they talked about their lives. Lily shared how she often felt lonely at school, while Jack revealed that he had a sick sister who couldn’t leave their home. They both understood what it felt like to wish for something more.

Suddenly, the air grew still, and a soft hoot echoed through the garden. They turned to see a majestic owl perched on a low branch of the oak tree. Its feathers shimmered in the sunlight, and its eyes sparkled with wisdom.

“Welcome, young ones,” the owl said in a deep, soothing voice. “You have shown kindness and belief. What is it that you seek?”

Lily and Jack exchanged glances, unsure of what to say. Finally, Lily spoke up. “I wish for Jack’s sister to get better.”

The owl nodded slowly. “True friendship and selflessness are the greatest forms of magic. I will grant your wish, but remember, kindness must be shared.”

With a flap of its wings, the owl vanished into the air, leaving behind a soft glow. Jack looked at Lily, tears of gratitude in his eyes. “Thank you, Lily. You’ve given me hope.”

As the sun began to set, they promised to meet again in the garden. They had found not only magic but also a friendship that would last a lifetime.

## A Special Tree

one day, when Rakesh was six, he walked home from the Mussoorie bazaar eating
cherries. They were a little sweet, a little sour; small, bright red cherries, which
had come all the way from the Kashmir Valley.
Here in the Himalayan foothills where Rakesh lived, there were not many fruit trees.
The soil was stony, and the dry cold winds stunted the growth of most plants. But on the
more sheltered slopes there were forests of oak and deodar.
Rakesh lived with his grandfather on the outskirts of Mussoorie, just where the
forest began. His father and mother lived in a small village fifty miles away, where they
grew maize and rice and barley in narrow terraced fields on the lower slopes of the
mountain. But there were no schools in the village, and Rakesh’s parents were keen that
he should go to school. As soon as he was of school-going age, they sent him to stay
with his grandfather in Mussoorie.
He had a little cottage outside the town.
Rakesh was on his way home from school when he bought the cherries. He paid fifty
paise for the bunch. It took him about half-an-hour to walk home, and by the time he
reached the cottage there were only three cherries left.
‘Have a cherry, Grandfather,’ he said, as soon as he saw his grandfather in the
garden.
Grandfather took one cherry and Rakesh promptly ate the other two. He kept the last
seed in his mouth for some time, rolling it round and round on his tongue until all the
tang had gone. Then he placed the seed on the palm of his hand and studied it.
‘Are cherry seeds lucky?’ asked Rakesh.
‘Of course.’
‘Then I’ll keep it.’
‘Nothing is lucky if you put it away. If you want luck, you must put it to some use.’
‘What can I do with a seed?’
‘Plant it.’
So Rakesh found a small space and began to dig up a flowerbed.
‘Hey, not there,’ said Grandfather, ‘I’ve sown mustard in that bed. Plant it in that
shady corner, where it won’t be disturbed.’
Rakesh went to a corner of the garden where the earth was soft and yielding. He did
not have to dig. He pressed the seed into the soil with his thumb and it went right in.
Then he had his lunch, and ran off to play cricket with his friends, and forgot all
about the cherry seed.
When it was winter in the hills, a cold wind blew down from the snows and wentwhoo-whoo-whoo in the deodar trees, and the garden was dry and bare. In the evenings
Grandfather and Rakesh sat over a charcoal fire, and Grandfather told Rakesh stories –
stories about people who turned into animals, and ghosts who lived in trees, and beans
that jumped and stones that wept – and in turn Rakesh would read to him from the
newspaper, Grandfather’s eyesight being rather weak. Rakesh found the newspaper
very dull – especially after the stories – but Grandfather wanted all the news…
They knew it was spring when the wild duck flew north again, to Siberia. Early in
the morning, when he got up to chop wood and light a fire, Rakesh saw the V–shaped
formation streaming northward, the calls of the birds carrying clearly through the thin
mountain air.
One morning in the garden he bent to pick up what he thought was a small twig and
found to his surprise that it was well rooted. He stared at it for a moment, then ran to
fetch Grandfather, calling, ‘Dada, come and look, the cherry tree has come up!’
‘What cherry tree?’ asked Grandfather, who had forgotten about it. ‘The seed we
planted last year – look, it’s come up!’
Rakesh went down on his haunches, while Grandfather bent almost double and
peered down at the tiny tree. It was about four inches high.
‘Yes, it’s a cherry tree,’ said Grandfather. ‘You should water it now and then.’
Rakesh ran indoors and came back with a bucket of water.
‘Don’t drown it!’ said Grandfather.
Rakesh gave it a sprinkling and circled it with pebbles.
‘What are the pebbles for?’ asked Grandfather.
‘For privacy,’ said Rakesh.
He looked at the tree every morning but it did not seem to be growing very fast, so
he stopped looking at it except quickly, out of the corner of his eye. And, after a week
or two, when he allowed himself to look at it properly, he found that it had grown – at
least an inch!
That year the monsoon rains came early and Rakesh plodded to and from school in
raincoat and chappals. Ferns sprang from the trunks of trees, strange-looking lilies
came up in the long grass, and even when it wasn’t raining the trees dripped and mist
came curling up the valley. The cherry tree grew quickly in this season.
It was about two feet high when a goat entered the garden and ate all the leaves.
Only the main stem and two thin branches remained.
‘Never mind,’ said Grandfather, seeing that Rakesh was upset. ‘It will grow again,
cherry trees are tough.’
Towards the end of the rainy season new leaves appeared on the tree. Then a woman
cutting grass scrambled down the hillside, her scythe swishing through the heavy
monsoon foliage. She did not try to avoid the tree: one sweep, and the cherry tree was
cut in two.
When Grandfather saw what had happened, he went after the woman and scoldedher; but the damage could not be repaired.
‘Maybe it will die now,’ said Rakesh.
‘Maybe,’ said Grandfather.
But the cherry tree had no intention of dying.
By the time summer came round again, it had sent out several new shoots with tender
green leaves. Rakesh had grown taller too. He was eight now, a sturdy boy with curly
black hair and deep black eyes. ‘Blackberry eyes,’ Grandfather called them.
That monsoon Rakesh went home to his village, to help his father and mother with
the planting and ploughing and sowing. He was thinner but stronger when he came back
to Grandfather’s house at the end of the rains to find that the cherry tree had grown
another foot. It was now up to his chest.
Even when there was rain, Rakesh would sometimes water the tree. He wanted it to
know that he was there.
One day he found a bright green praying-mantis perched on a branch, peering at him
with bulging eyes. Rakesh let it remain there; it was the cherry tree’s first visitor.
The next visitor was a hairy caterpillar, who started making a meal of the leaves.
Rakesh removed it quickly and dropped it on a heap of dry leaves.
Come back when you’re a butterfly,’ he said.
Winter came early. The cherry tree bent low with the weight of snow. Field-mice
sought shelter in the roof of the cottage. The road from the valley was blocked, and for
several days there was no newspaper, and this made Grandfather quite grumpy. His
stories began to have unhappy endings.
In February it was Rakesh’s birthday. He was nine – and the tree was four, but
almost as tall as Rakesh.
One morning, when the sun came out, Grandfather came into the garden to ‘let some
warmth get into my bones,’ as he put it. He stopped in front of the cherry tree, stared at
it for a few moments, and then called out, ‘Rakesh! Come and look! Come quickly
before it falls!’
Rakesh and Grandfather gazed at the tree as though it had performed a miracle.
There was a pale pink blossom at the end of a branch.
The following year there were more blossoms. And suddenly the tree was taller than
Rakesh, even though it was less than half his age. And then it was taller than
Grandfather, who was older than some of the oak trees.
But Rakesh had grown too. He could run and jump and climb trees as well as most
boys, and he read a lot of books, although he still liked listening to Grandfather’s tales.
In the cherry tree, bees came to feed on the nectar in the blossoms, and tiny birds
pecked at the blossoms and broke them off. But the tree kept blossoming right through
the spring, and there were always more blossoms than birds.
That summer there were small cherries on the tree. Rakesh tasted one and spat it out.
‘It’s too sour,’ he said.‘They’ll be better next year,’ said Grandfather.
But the birds liked them – especially the bigger birds, such as the bulbuls and scarlet
minivets – and they flitted in and out of the foliage, feasting on the cherries.
On a warm sunny afternoon, when even the bees looked sleepy, Rakesh was looking
for Grandfather without finding him in any of his favourite places around the house.
Then he looked out of the bedroom window and saw Grandfather reclining on a cane
chair under the cherry tree.
‘There’s just the right amount of shade here,’ said Grandfather. ‘And I like looking at
the leaves.’
‘They’re pretty leaves,’ said Rakesh. ‘And they are always ready to dance, if there’s
a breeze.’
After Grandfather had come indoors, Rakesh went into the garden and lay down on
the grass beneath the tree. He gazed up through the leaves at the great blue sky; and
turning on his side, he could see the mountains striding away into the clouds. He was
still lying beneath the tree when the evening shadows crept across the garden.
Grandfather came back and sat down beside Rakesh, and they waited in silence until
the stars came out and the nightjar began to call. In the forest below, the crickets and
cicadas began tuning up; and suddenly the trees were full of the sound of insects.
‘There are so many trees in the forest,’ said Rakesh. ‘What’s so special about this
tree? Why do we like it so much?’
‘We planted it ourselves,’ said Grandfather. That’s why it’s special.’
‘Just one small seed,’ said Rakesh, and he touched the smooth bark of the tree that he
had grown. He ran his hand along the trunk of the tree and put his finger to the tip of a
leaf. ‘I wonder,’ he whispered. ‘Is this what it feels to be God?’

## The Wind on Haunted Hill

Whoo, whoo, whoo, cried the wind as it swept down from the Himalayan snows. It
hurried over the hills and passed and hummed and moaned through the tall pines
and deodars. There was little on Haunted Hill to stop the wind – only a few stunted
trees and bushes and the ruins of a small settlement.
On the slopes of the next hill was a village. People kept large stones on their tin
roofs to prevent them from being blown off. There was nearly always a strong wind in
these parts. Three children were spreading clothes out to dry on a low stone wall,
putting a stone on each piece.
Eleven-year-old Usha, dark-haired and rose-cheeked, struggled with her
grandfather’s long, loose shirt. Her younger brother, Suresh, was doing his best to hold
down a bedsheet, while Usha’s friend, Binya, a slightly older girl, helped.
Once everything was firmly held down by stones, they climbed up on the flat rocks
and sat there sunbathing and staring across the fields at the ruins on Haunted Hill.
‘I must go to the bazaar today,’ said Usha.
‘I wish I could come too,’ said Binya. ‘But I have to help with the cows.’
‘I can come!’ said eight-year-old Suresh. He was always ready to visit the bazaar,
which was three miles away, on the other side of the hill.
‘No, you can’t,’ said Usha. ‘You must help Grandfather chop wood.’
‘Won’t you feel scared returning alone?’ he asked. ‘There are ghosts on Haunted
Hill!’
‘I’ll be back before dark. Ghosts don’t appear during the day.’
‘Are there lots of ghosts in the ruins?’ asked Binya.
‘Grandfather says so. He says that over a hundred years ago, some Britishers lived
on the hill. But the settlement was always being struck by lightning, so they moved
away.’
‘But if they left, why is the place visited by ghosts?’
‘Because – Grandfather says – during a terrible storm, one of the houses was hit by
lightning, and everyone in it was killed. Even the children.’
‘How many children?’
‘Two. A boy and his sister. Grandfather saw them playing there in the moonlight.’
‘Wasn’t he frightened?’
‘No. Old people don’t mind ghosts.’
Usha set out for the bazaar at two in the afternoon. It was about an hour’s walk. The
path went through yellow fields of flowering mustard, then along the saddle of the hill,and up, straight through the ruins. Usha had often gone that way to shop at the bazaar or
to see her aunt, who lived in the town nearby.
Wild flowers bloomed on the crumbling walls of the ruins, and a wild plum tree
grew straight out of the floor of what had once been a hall. It was covered with soft,
white blossoms. Lizards scuttled over the stones, while a whistling thrush, its deep
purple plumage glistening in the sunshine, sat on a window-sill and sang its heart out.
Usha sang too, as she skipped lightly along the path, which dipped steeply down to
the valley and led to the little town with its quaint bazaar.
Moving leisurely, Usha bought spices, sugar and matches. With the two rupees she
had saved from her pocket-money, she chose a necklace of amber-coloured beads for
herself and some marbles for Suresh. Then she had her mother’s slippers repaired at a
cobbler’s shop.
Finally, Usha went to visit Aunt Lakshmi at her flat above the shops. They were
talking and drinking cups of hot, sweet tea when Usha realised that dark clouds had
gathered over the mountains. She quickly picked up her things, said goodbye to her aunt,
and set out for the village.
Strangely, the wind had dropped. The trees were still, the crickets silent. The crows
flew round in circles, then settled on an oak tree.
‘I must get home before dark,’ thought Usha, hurrying along the path.
But the sky had darkened and a deep rumble echoed over the hills. Usha felt the first
heavy drop of rain hit her cheek. Holding the shopping bag close to her body, she
quickened her pace until she was almost running. The raindrops were coming down
faster now – cold, stinging pellets of rain. A flash of lightning sharply outlined the ruins
on the hill, and then all was dark again. Night had fallen.
‘I’ll have to shelter in the ruins,’ Usha thought and began to run. Suddenly the wind
sprang up again, but she did not have to fight it. It was behind her now, helping her
along, up the steep path and on to the brow of the hill. There was another flash of
lightning, followed by a peal of thunder. The ruins loomed before her, grim and
forbidding.
Usha remembered part of an old roof that would give some shelter. It would be
better than trying to go on. In the dark, with the howling wind, she might stray off the
path and fall over the edge of the cliff.
Whoo, whoo, whoo, howled the wind. Usha saw the wild plum tree swaying, its
foliage thrashing against the ground. She found her way into the ruins, helped by the
constant flicker of lightning. Usha placed her hands flat against a stone wall and moved
sideways, hoping to reach the sheltered corner. Suddenly, her hand touched something
soft and furry, and she gave a startled cry. Her cry was answered by another – half
snarl, half screech – as something leapt away in the darkness.
With a sigh of relief Usha realised that it was the cat that lived in the ruins. For a
moment she had been frightened, but now she moved quickly along the wall until sheheard the rain drumming on a remnant of a tin roof. Crouched in a corner, she found
some shelter. But the tin sheet groaned and clattered as if it would sail away any
moment.
Usha remembered that across this empty room stood an old fireplace. Perhaps it
would be drier there under the blocked chimney. But she would not attempt to find it
just now – she might lose her way altogether.
Her clothes were soaked and water streamed down from her hair, forming a puddle
at her feet. She thought she heard a faint cry – the cat again, or an owl? Then the storm
blotted out all other sounds.
There had been no time to think of ghosts, but now that she was settled in one place,
Usha remembered Grandfather’s story about the lightning-blasted ruins. She hoped and
prayed that lightning would not strike her.
Thunder boomed over the hills, and the lightning came quicker now. Then there was
a bigger flash, and for a moment the entire ruin was lit up. A streak of blue sizzled
along the floor of the building. Usha was staring straight ahead, and, as the opposite
wall lit up, she saw, crouching in front of the unused fireplace, two small figures –
children!
The ghostly figures seemed to look up and stare back at Usha. And then everything
was dark again.
Usha’s heart was in her mouth. She had seen without doubt, two ghosts on the other
side of the room. She wasn’t going to remain in the ruins one minute longer.
She ran towards the big gap in the wall through which she had entered. She was
halfway across the open space when something – someone – fell against her. Usha
stumbled, got up, and again bumped into something. She gave a frightened scream.
Someone else screamed. And then there was a shout, a boy’s shout, and Usha instantly
recognised the voice.
‘Suresh!’
‘Usha!’
‘Binya!’
They fell into each other’s arms, so surprised and relieved that all they could do
was laugh and giggle and repeat each other’s names.
Then Usha said, ‘I thought you were ghosts.’
‘We thought you were a ghost,’ said Suresh.
‘Come back under the roof,’ said Usha.
They huddled together in the corner, chattering with excitement and relief.
‘When it grew dark, we came looking for you,’ said Binya. ‘And then the storm
broke.’
‘Shall we run back together?’ asked Usha. ‘I don’t want to stay here any longer.’
‘We’ll have to wait,’ said Binya. ‘The path has fallen away at one place. It won’t be
safe in the dark, in all this rain.’‘We’ll have to wait till morning,’ said Suresh, ‘and I’m so hungry!’
The storm continued, but they were not afraid now. They gave each other warmth
and confidence. Even the ruins did not seem so forbidding.
After an hour the rain stopped, and the thunder grew more distant.
Towards dawn the whistling thrush began to sing. Its sweet, broken notes flooded
the ruins with music. As the sky grew lighter, they saw that the plum tree stood upright
again, though it had lost all its blossoms.
‘Let’s go,’ said Usha.
Outside the ruins, walking along the brow of the hill, they watched the sky grow
pink. When they were some distance away, Usha looked back and said, ‘Can you see
something behind the wall? It’s like a hand waving.’
‘It’s just the top of the plum tree,’ said Binya.
‘Goodbye, goodbye…’ They heard voices.
‘Who said “goodbye”?’ asked Usha.
‘Not I,’ said Suresh.
‘Nor I,’ said Binya.
‘I heard someone calling,’ said Usha.
‘It’s only the wind,’ assured Binya.
Usha looked back at the ruins. The sun had come up and was touching the top of the
wall.
‘Come on,’ said Suresh. ‘I’m hungry.’
They hurried along the path to the village.
‘Goodbye, goodbye…’ Usha heard them calling. Or was it just the wind?
